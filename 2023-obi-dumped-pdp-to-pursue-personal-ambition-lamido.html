I don’t want to talk about personalities, I want to talk about issues but you are pushing me to talk about personalities, mentioning names, you are not being fair to me.</p><p>“We have to be honest to have the courage to say the right thing. Was (Peter) Obi a PDP member? He ran under the All Progressive Grand Alliance and won the election as a governor and at the end of his tenure, he came to the PDP. He was then made a running mate to Atiku in 2019 even though there were people who were in the PDP and were older than him as members of the PDP.</p><p>“They were jettisoned and abandoned and he was picked, this is a very clear history. So, the PDP dignified him, The PDP honoured him because of what he got.</p><p>“In terms of contribution, in terms of reward, many others deserved that better than him in the South-East. He ran in 2019 as VP and this time around, he tried to run for president under the PDP, and then, he left. Ideally, he should have gone back to his former party, APGA, if you are talking about principles, honour, and character because that is what made him what he is in life.</p><p>“If he abandoned the PDP that made him a VP in the election, gave him a bigger platform, and made him known in Nigeria, he should have gone back to APGA and run under APGA but then, he felt that his fortunes cannot be under APGA, so it is not about Nigeria but his personal interest.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BpZmtoYmh6sK7IZpuupaCasW68w6lkraddpcKzv9SeZKmdoqi8r63LZpimmpmptrC6jKWYpqGUpHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charisma-kain-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charisma Kain - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./you-abandoned-us-to-herdsmen-ortom-tells-atiku-abubakar.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>You Abandoned Us To Herdsmen</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
