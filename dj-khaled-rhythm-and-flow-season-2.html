DJ Khaled is joining co-judges Latto and Ludacris for Season 2, which is expected to return in 2024 after a two-year hiatus.</p><p>We sat down with Khaled, who opened up about judging the upcoming season of the reality TV competition series.

Khaled, Latto, and <a href=#>Ludacris</a> were tasked with discovering America’s next rap star, but it wasn’t easy.</p><p>“It was hard sometimes to tell somebody that 'I thought you could have did better,'” he said. “But at the same time, I'm telling them — that doesn't mean you're not going to be the next biggest thing.”</p><p>He added: “When we had to judge, I always said, ‘I ain't nobody to judge, but I can give you some keys. I think you need to fix this, or work on this, or do this.'”</p><p>Throughout the process, Khaled was careful not to count anyone out. After all, after almost two decades in the business, he’s no stranger to being slept on.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Sean Gardner/Getty Images</span></figure><p>“I just don't sleep on nobody because I know people slept on me. And that was a big mistake for them to do that — and I mean that in a humble way,” the producer said.</p><p>DJ Khaled’s massive fortune is no secret, and he has the keys to help rising stars see the same success.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">If you’re an aspiring artist, you need to hear this sage advice from DJ Khaled.</h2><p>At the end of the competition, the prevailing Rhythm and Flow contestant will take home a <a href=#>$250,000 prize</a>. And while there are winners and losers in every competition, every loss is a win, according to Khaled.</p><p>“Sometimes you got to remind people that there's hope. But you have to know it and want it and take those steps,” Khaled said. “Because you know, you not winning does not mean you didn't win. That means that was just a step to the win.”</p><p>The producer added: “You smile when you want to smile and you can win when you want to win.”</p><p>However, Khaled warned that a career can’t survive off of hope alone — it takes persistence to be the best.</p><p>“It didn't happen overnight for me,” Khaled shared. “I know it didn't happen overnight for nobody.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Mike Coppola/Getty Images for DJEEP Lighters</span></figure><p>Now that Khaled has reached the top, he can enjoy the fruits of his labor. Between working on his new album and starring in Season 2 of Rhythm and Flow, Khaled doesn’t get a lot of downtime.</p><p>However, when he does find time to unwind, his handy dandy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DJEEP lighter</a> is always at his side. From the golf course to the studio, Khaled keeps one of the premium lighters on him at all times.</p><p>“I really flick lighters,” Khaled shared. “I love cigars, like on the golf course,” he added. “Then I also love Diptyque candles. I light my candles up and like, you know, put them in the studio around the house. It got that, that spa feel — that calm.”</p><p>“It's this one particular lighter, you can flick with 3500 times,” he said of the premium smoke accessory, which, much like Khaled, drops fire every single time.</p><p>Learn more about DJEEP lighters <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbdut8eao56cXae1usDHpmSappRis6271maqnpmjpLtufg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./march21-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>March 21 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./endsars-protesters-stole-2m-n17m-from-me-oba-akiolu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'#EndSARS Protesters' Stole $2m, N17m From Me</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
