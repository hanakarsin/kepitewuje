This resulted in unimaginable impunities and the wanton desecration of national values, wealth, and resources. Those in opposition were humiliated, degraded, and persecuted with the massive might of the state.</p><p>“However, in the last seven months, under the new administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, there is renewed confidence in the Nigerian project, especially in observing best democratic practices. This government definitely appears to have regard for the liberty and freedom of individuals as well as for transparency and accountability.</p><p>“The most reassuring step is the genuine, determined and uncompromising fight against corruption and financial crimes in the country, different and distinct from a fight targeted at opposition figures whilst protecting and sparing those on the corridors of powers.</p><p>“Today, we see serving ministers and people who are holding top offices being removed from office and investigated for prosecution over corruption and financial crimes.</p><p>“In the past, the fight against corruption was merely a political cum campaign tool fueled with massive media trials and only targeted at diminishing opposition shinning talents. The fight against corruption is now distinctive to persons who have questions to answer and not a tool for persecution.</p><p>“More importantly, there is no more demarketing of Nigerians and Nigeria as a nation by those who tagged our hardworking youth as lazy and tarred innocent and resourceful Nigerians on the international arena with the brush of corruption.</p><p>“Nigerians across board, have applauded the unprecedented patriotic stand for good governance in cutting the cost of governance at the federal level reflected in the recent slashing of all official entourage to state and international events by 60 per cent.</p><p>“President Tinubu has demonstrated proactive leadership; a listening and approachable leadership that respects the sensibilities of Nigerians as well as the need to re-engineer our nation for greater multi-sectoral productivity.</p><p>“This uncommon patriotism requires the recognition and support of all well-meaning Nigerians within the public, private and civil society sectors irrespective of political, ethnic, religious or vocational affiliations.</p><p>“From that standpoint, I call on all Nigerians to set aside every sectional, political and religious sentiments and put the national interest first by supporting President Tinubu bearing in mind that his success is the nation’s success today and for generations yet unborn.</p><p>“Nigeria’s future is much better served by contributions, inputs and constructive criticisms as obligations and duties of responsible citizens in every participatory democracy.</p><p>“Finally, it is evident that there is a sure and steady move to where we want to be as a nation. This government indeed, is reflective of a good work in progress.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BuZq6mnJ64pnnBrp%2Baqpliwaq61JusZqafqXq2v8innmaZnqm2bq%2FOq6muqKSevK95xaKeoaxdqbxuw8itmqFlmKq7tXnOqaeoq5mptrC6jKmYq6yZmsBuu8uiqpplnZrBtrSO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zoning-cannot-stop-my-presidential-ambition-yerima.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zoning Cannot Stop My Presidential Ambition Yerima</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./march21-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>March 21 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
