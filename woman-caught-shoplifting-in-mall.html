However, many mall frequenters know that other shoppers have ulterior motives, such as window shopping for their dream items or even going as far as to shoplift — or steal — the desired things.</p><p>In August 2023, shoppers at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twelve Oaks Mall</a>, a mall in Metro Detroit, Mich., recorded a woman who was, unfortunately, attempting to do the latter. However, once the police caught her trying to shoplift, their actions became so shocking that one shopper, who goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@paxton_wallrunning</a> on <a href=#>TikTok</a>, documented the entire ordeal on their platform.</p><p>Keep scrolling to find out what happened.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A woman sparked outrage after police arrested her for shoplifting in a mall.</h2><p>During a routine shopping trip, Paxton and his friends walked through the first floor of Twelve Oaks. While shopping, they noticed a woman running into a JCPenney to avoid being caught by the mall’s police officers.</p><p>In the TikToker’s caption, they explained that the woman stole from a nearby <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bath and Body Works</a> and ran through <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JCPenney</a> once the salesperson alerted the police. Once they saw the woman enter JCPenney, they and several other people from the first floor rushed upstairs to get a better view of what was happening.</p><p>When the TikToker and their friends made it upstairs, they zoomed in on the woman, eventually being caught by the police officers. As the user kept recording, they recalled that the same cop had “yelled” at them before they found the shoplifter.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@paxton_wallrunning href=#>@paxton_wallrunning</a><p><a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=bathandbodyworks href=#>#bathandbodyworks</a> she stole from bath and body works and ran</p><a title="♬ original sound - ." href=#>♬ original sound - .</a></figure><p>The woman, now handcuffed, sat on the JCPenney sales floor as the police monitored her. While still in handcuffs, she tried to escape the police, but they stopped her by pushing her down on the floor and yelled at her to “sit down!”</p><p>Seeing the woman, who appeared to be Black, being slammed to the ground by two white police officers activated a white female onlooker’s rage.</p><p>The white woman, who wasn’t quite a <a href=#>Karen</a>, in my opinion, but more like a Kelsey, proceeded to yell at the cops and said they didn’t have to be so “aggressive” with the shoplifter, to which they replied, “thank you for your service!” in the most shady way ever.</p><p>Kelsey, Paxton, and other shoppers followed the woman as the two officers held onto her arms and walked her out of JCPenney.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@paxton_wallrunning</a></figure><p>After Paxton convinced his “gang” (not a real gang, think ‘gang gang’ or a ‘squad’) to follow the woman who shoplifted as she made her way out of the mall, he re-recorded her. Only this time, the woman tried to run away from the officers again to no avail.</p><p>Since the police weren’t far away from her, they continued escorting her out of the mall as the Paxton asked, “Why did she try to run again?”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@paxton_wallrunning</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The woman didn’t receive much support for her actions on TikTok.</h2><p>Following Paxton’s TikTok of the woman getting arrested for shoplifting, the video went viral, garnering over 1 million views on the user’s channel. The user also received several comments on their take on the situation.</p><p>In the comments, many disagreed with Kelsey’s previous claims that the officers were too aggressive with the woman.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@paxton_wallrunning</a></figure><p>While the officers should’ve handled the situation differently, several users pointed out that the shoplifter explicitly yelled profanities at the officers and tried to escape them multiple times.</p><p>“Play stupid games, win stupid prizes,” one user said.</p><p>“They keep telling her to sit down, and she keeps getting back up, and y'all upset,” another wrote. “So what? They’re grown men; they’re also doing their jobs.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mmpqtl53Bbr%2FHqKeloZaptq%2BzjKKlZqWRobk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./frances-fallon-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Frances Fallon - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-tambuwal-hints-on-accepting-vice-presidential-slot.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tambuwal Hints On Accepting Vice-presidential Slot</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
