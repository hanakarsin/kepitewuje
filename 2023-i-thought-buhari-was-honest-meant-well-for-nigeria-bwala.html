I considered him someone honest and who meant well for Nigeria, and I thought that was enough to bring about change. So I decided to support him and the platform upon which he was running and was governing.</p><p>“I also thought that at that time, we had tried the capitalist philosophy, which was canvassed by the Peoples Democratic Party (free market economy), and there was an outcry and widespread belief that there was poverty in the land.</p><p>“We thought the socialist ideology of the APC was going to help through social investment programmes and interventionist policy. But after seven years, I realise that has not worked because all the social investment programmes of the party that were implemented in one state or the other always had strong criticism from people owing to lack of accountability and waste related matters.</p><p>“When you look at the privatisation of the downstream sector in the oil industry, even when they say they have turned it into a limited company, you can see it is still controlled and influenced by the government.</p><p>“After seeing how public institutions and enterprise are dying because of corruption and lack of administration, I decided that the idea of a free market economy where you allow full private participation in business is likely going to help Nigeria lift people out of poverty.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BvZmtoYmh6qnnToaaun5ipeqPBx5qpomWnlsButM6nnKysXaKyorrTZq6epJxis7C%2BjKegoJ2inq5urtaao5pn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-will-tackle-floods-other-issues-in-kogi-if-i-become-president-tinubu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I Will Tackle Floods, Other Issues In Kogi If I Become President</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1164659-types-igbo-culture-food-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 tasty Igbo foods, their names, pictures, and ingredients</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
