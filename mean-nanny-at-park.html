Thanks to a follow-up video, TikTokers learned that they ultimately did decide to say something.</p><p>"I wish there was more of a story time but really, I had just seen this nanny at the park before with this like 12 month old kid probably. And she just manhandled him and always yelled when correcting his behavior always," the TikToker says as they talk into the camera, widening their eyes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jayruinsthemself href=#>@jayruinsthemself</a><p>Replying to @Aliza okay here’s pt 2 to nanny drama and if you make fun of my dangly arm you’re just mean</p><a title="♬ original sound - jay" href=#>♬ original sound - jay</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @jayruinsthemself</span></figure><p>Jay then goes on to state that upon seeing the parents of the kid who has to deal with Nanny Dearest on a daily basis, that they decided to bite the bullet and tell the parents what the other nanny was doing behind their backs.</p><p>"And so, yeah, I went over to the parents and I was just like, 'Hey you don't know me, but I've seen your nanny with your kiddo at the park before and your kiddo's really sweet and he always wants to play with my kids and I just think you should know that if I were a parent, I would want my nanny to be kinder to my kid than your nanny is to your kid,'" the TikToker remarked.</p><p>They continued, "And they were just like, 'Oh my God. What do you mean? I'm sorry who are you?' And I was like, I kind of tried to explain like, 'You don't know me but I've seen your kid around because I'm a nanny and we're at this park a lot' ... there was a bit of a language barrier, it was a little complicated," they explained to their audience.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jayruinsthemself</span></figure><p>Jay continued with their story time: "But I did my best and eventually they were like, 'OK well, thank you so much,' and they were on their way out so they just left. And here's hoping next week they have a new nanny," they said while crossing their fingers.</p><p>Sadly, there have been a number of instances where nannies have been caught abusing children. A 2023 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a> article details how a NY mother saw evidence of a former friend she entrusted to look after her child hit him for the entire duration of a commercial break.</p><p>The same woman put her foot on the head of the child as he laid down. Upon catching her hitting her kid on a Ring camera, the mom rushed home to protect her baby and called the police, who arrested the ex-friend for endangering the welfare of a child.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jayruinsthemself</span></figure><p>Then there was this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">News 4</a> story where a nanny was caught, also on camera, abusing a disabled child. In a similar instance, another nanny who had come "highly recommended" from a mom's Facebook group was caught on camera pushing food into the mouth of a toddler she was looking after.</p><p>The boy's mother noticed that after the nanny had watched her kid on a few occasions, bruises had been showing up on his arms. The video ultimately <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caught the nanny in the act of harming her child</a>. Then there was the case of another mother who also found a nanny in a Facebook group and shared her story in the hopes of stopping the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nanny in question for working for another family again</a>.</p><p>Numerous TikTokers who responded to Jay's video remarked that they were happy Jay decided to bring up the issue with the nanny to the parents, ultimately being an advocate for children in the process: "You definitely did the right thing; we should always strive to speak up for those that can't speak up for themselves."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jayruinsthemself</span></figure><p>Another remarked that they wish they had someone on their side like Jay as a kid: "Thank you for speaking up. A lot of people saw me mistreated as a child, and no one ever did anything. Thank you. You’re a good person."</p><p>Someone else said that even if the parents didn't go out of their way to replace the nanny, they might've spoken to her in a way that would inspire the woman to come correct: "At the very least they probably talked to her and now she knows someone out there is watching!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforKiuoynmKemqWKutXnPmqmk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./262379-stop-asking-how-join-illuminati-kenya-become-rich-without-them-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stop Asking How to Join Illuminati in Kenya; Become Rich Without Them</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./project-rose-meaning.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Britney Spears Explains She Wore the Same Top on Instagram 17 Times for &amp;quot;Project Rose&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
