Or witnessed a viral trend that originated with pure intentions, only for it to be twisted into something less than innocent?&nbsp;</p><p>This is the concept of "milkshake duck," a phrase that originated from a viral tweet and has been folded into internet vernacular. Here's what <a href=#>Milkshake Duck </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">means</a>, broken down.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what does Milkshake Duck mean?</h2><p>The phrase "Milkshake Duck" originated in 2016, via a popular Twitter user named Ben Ward, whose handle is @pixelatedboat. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The tweet reads</a>, "The whole internet loves Milkshake Duck, a lovely duck that drinks milkshakes! *5 seconds later* We regret to inform you the duck is racist." The tweet itself has racked up over 44,000 likes but resurfaced again when a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming developer was revealed</a> to have an offensive tweet history.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"cinnamon toast shrimp guy turned out to be a milkshake duck just like bean dad" is a sentence I desperately wish I did not understand</p>— Janel Comeau (@VeryBadLlama) <a href=#>March 24, 2021</a></figure><p>The gaming community began to refer to these situations as "milkshake ducks," and a new phrase was born! You could compare the phrase to the Tumblr-coined "problematic fave," which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vox</a>&nbsp;describes as our loss of faith in our heroes over time. The Milkshake Duck phenomenon could also be described with the phrase "this is why we can't have nice things."</p><p>To those who spend a lot of time on the internet, Milkshake Duck has evolved into a very bleak look at meme culture, where at any given point anyone who posts a fun joke or wholesome bit of content could suddenly be revealed to have a dark side.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>bean dad was terrible from the start and therefore not a true milkshake duck, whereas we all briefly sided with cinnamon toast shrimp guy putting him more on par with lawyer cat. in this essay i will</p>— Emma (@emmawdwrd) <a href=#>March 24, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What are some notable instances of Milkshake Ducks?</h2><p>The most recent instance of Milkshake Duck was the viral tweet by Jensen Karp, a current producer and former rapper who went by the name of Hot Karl. He's also the husband of Boy Meets World star Danielle Fishel.&nbsp;</p><p>Jensen recently went viral when he <a href=#>found discarded shrimp tails</a> in his box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal, causing internet panic and uproar. General Mills claimed they were investigating the issue shortly after.</p><p>Unfortunately, shortly after Jensen went viral, it was revealed that he was accused of abuse by not one but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple of his ex-girlfriends</a> on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. They have stated that since coming forward with their experiences, other women have continued to reach out regarding the abuse they faced at Jensen's hands.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans and Twitter observers also pointed out that Danielle, his wife, participated in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">racist bullying of former cast member</a> of Boy Meets World Trina McGee.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ummmm <a href=#>@CTCSquares</a> - why are there shrimp tails in my cereal?

Pyle and his viral cartoons about aliens that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">contrast with his anti-abortion views</a>, and <a href=#>the bean dad</a> trying to teach his daughter a lesson.</p><p>There have been a few examples of "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reverse Milkshake Duck</a>," where people who have gone viral for bad reasons explain themselves into likability. The term, however goofy-sounding, is sure to spark future debates on viral internet culture for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXaK2rbfSoZiknV2ZwqS3jKacmqY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bratzthemovie-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bratz: The Movie - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./benny-imprint-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>King Imprint - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
