We investigate: Is she still on good terms with her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ex-husbands today?</a>&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Demi Moore has remained on good terms with (some of) her ex-husbands.</h2><p>Demi got married to her first husband, Freddy, at the age of just 18.&nbsp;</p><p>Their turbulent relationship inspired songs like the rock anthem, "It's Not a Rumor." Co-written by the two stars, the lyrics revolve around the poisonous effect lies or playing games can have on a relationship.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The stars opted for divorce in 1985, but Demi continued to use his last name. She was briefly engaged to actor Emilio Estevez before meeting the man whom she'd be frequently associated with for the rest of her life.&nbsp;</p><p>Demi met Bruce Willis for the first time in August 1987. In fewer than four months, they got married and started a family. Their first daughter, Rumer Glenn Willis, was born on August 16, 1988.&nbsp;</p><p>"Basically he wanted to do whatever the f--k he wanted," Demi described the early days of their relationship in a previous interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail.&nbsp;</a></p><p>As the actress explained, Bruce insisted on further expanding the family, begging Demi to stay at home with the children. She refused to obey.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The marriage lasted for more than 13 years, but it was less than idyllic at times.&nbsp;</p><p>Take Demi's historic <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a> cover story in 1991, which cemented her status as an A-lister while describing her success as one that boiled down to "the entourage factor," i.e. "being lucky and marrying well."&nbsp;</p><p>Arguably, the article magnifies the difficulties Demi was facing at the time, such as the pressure to be a good mother while further expanding her career.&nbsp;</p><p>Demi gave birth to her second daughter, Scout LaRue, in 1991, and her third, Talulah, in 1994. She continued to build her career as an actress throughout this time, landing roles in hit movies like The Butcher's Wife, Indecent Proposal, or A Few Good Men while looking after her kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Frequently hailed as "Hollywood's Hottest Couple" by the press, the two stars faced mounting pressure to maintain a pitch-perfect public facade while dealing with more and more disagreements at home.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>They opted for a divorce in 2000. Five years later, Demi met Ashton Kutcher — back then a rising star who turned out to be a caring and generous father for the girls.&nbsp;</p><p>They spent the next&nbsp;eight years together. However, Demi's struggles to cope with the traumatic impact of a miscarriage, and Ashton's increasing insistence on pursuing an open relationship — which sparked several cheating scandals — brought about the end of the relationship.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Demi and Bruce are still close friends.</h2><p>Demi maintained close-knit friendships with some of her exes. In fact, she is currently quarantining with Bruce — a decision they made in the best interest of their kids.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a previous <a href=#>Distractify</a> article, Bruce's second wife, Emma Heming Willis, is fully supportive of the arrangement as well. It's understood that they came up with the plans so that Bruce can spend time with the separate branches of his family.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Family book club... ⁣ How to Rule the World from Your Couch — quarantine edition.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Demi Moore</a> (@demimoore) on Apr 13, 2020 at 11:55am PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Currently, Demi is in a long-term relationship with Serbia-born stylist and fashion designer, Masha Mandzuka.
