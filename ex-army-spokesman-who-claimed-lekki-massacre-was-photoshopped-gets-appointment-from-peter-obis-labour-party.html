style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Labour Party (LP) has appointed an ex-army officer, <a href=#>John Enenche</a> who claimed that the images of the alleged massacre of unarmed demonstrators at Lekki Tollgate were photoshopped as part of its presidential advisory council.</h2><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls that Labour Party on Wednesday released a list of its campaign team, which had 1,234 names, including the army general appointed as a representative of the North-Central.</p><p>Enenche, had during the heat of the EndSARS massacre claimed that the Instagram live footage of DJ Switch, which showed protesters dying was photoshopped.</p><p>The video of his claims was posted on Twitter.</p><p>Enenche’s appointment has led to an outcry from the party supporters on Twitter who insist that he is not worthy of the position.</p><p>They argued that the retired general and former director of defence information is unsuitable to take up any position due to his role in covering up the Lekki massacre in October 2020.</p><p>According to Peoples Gazette, the campaign’s chief spokesman, Yunusa Tanko, did not immediately respond to requests seeking comments on the matter.</p><h2>Group Threatens To Abandon LP Over Presidential Campaign List</h2><p>The LP might have plunged itself into further controversies following reactions that have continued to trail the recently released presidential campaign list for the <a href=#>Obi-Datti 2023 candidacy.</a></p><p>This is as the leadership of the National Consultative Front (NCFront) which is the umbrella body for the 3rd force movement consisting of key political groups supporting the Labour Party has threatened to dump the party if the campaign list is not reviewed and adjusted accordingly.</p><p>The group submitted that the LP Presidential Campaign Council list released on Wednesday in Abuja only took care of Peter Obi’s associates and ignored other stakeholders supporting the party.</p><p>The NCFront further accused the party of failing to consult widely before announcing the list adding that there are many opportunists and liabilities in the released list.</p><p>It gave the Labour Party a time frame to review or they will dump the party and start negotiating with another political party.</p><p>The grievances were made known in a joint statement by the Communication Executive of NCFront -3rd Force Mega Coalition of Nigeria, Bilikis Bello and the Convener, 40Million Ballots Movement, Comrade Kennedy Iyere.</p><p class=postsid
