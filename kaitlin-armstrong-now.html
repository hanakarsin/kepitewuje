If one suspects their partner of cheating without proof, that's not a love triangle. At the very least, it's indicative of a relationship lacking in trust. At the most, it can possibly end in tragedy.</p><p>The murder of Moriah "Mo" Wilson, a promising young cyclist who had her entire life and career ahead of her, gripped the nation. Naturally she was friends with other cyclists, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin Strickland</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Strickland was in a relationship with Kaitlin Armstrong, a <a href=#>yoga teacher</a> from Texas who had a bit of a jealous streak. Although Wilson and Strickland were just friends, they dated briefly, but that was ancient history. However, Armstrong just couldn't let go of her suspicions about their friendship. Did this drive her to kill? Where is Kaitlin Armstrong now? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Kaitlin Armstrong now?</h2><p>Kaitlin Marie Armstrong is currently being held in the Travis County Jail while waiting to stand trial for the murder of professional cyclist Mo Wilson. Her bond has been set at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.5 million</a>. Armstrong was initially expected to appear in court in June 2023, but in May, the hearing was pushed to Oct. 30, 2023.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KXAN</a>, if convicted, Armstrong faces up to 99 years behind bars. She was captured in <a href=#>Costa Rica</a> on June 29, 2022, after a 43-day manhunt that concluded at a hostel where Armstrong was hiding after she allegedly killed Wilson on May 11, 2022, in Austin, Texas.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a> reported that the day after Wilson's murder, Armstrong was questioned by police about surveillance footage they had which showed her Jeep Grand Cherokee outside of the house where Wilson was killed. They later released Armstrong on a technicality. On May 13, 2022, she sold that same Jeep and fled the country.</p><p>In early June 2022, investigators received a tip about Armstrong's whereabouts that would lead them to Costa Rica. How did the subject of nationwide manhunt get on a plane without detection? It helps to use a <a href=#>passport that doesn't belong to you</a>. Brian Buckmire of Law & Crime Network pointed out to ABC News that if Armstrong stole the passport, that's another crime to add to the pile. But if it was given to her, then that person becomes an accessory.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>In a press conference about Armstrong's arrest, Deputy U.S. Marshall Brandon Filla revealed she was <a href=#>using several names</a> to evade capture: "It was discovered Armstrong used different alias, under the alias Beth Martin, Liz, and Ari Martin."</p><p>As if this wasn't suspicious enough, Armstrong drastically changed her appearance. She cut and dyed her hair and authorities believe she also got a nose job based on the receipt for plastic surgery they found in Armstrong's belongings. Despite all this, law enforcement finally arrested her.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened between Moriah Wilson, Kaitlin Armstrong, and Colin Strickland?</h2><p>This all began when Armstrong's live-in boyfriend, <a href=#>cyclist</a> Colin Strickland, went to visit Wilson when she was in Austin for a cycling event. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> said Strickland did not tell Armstrong where he was going on May 11, 2022, when he "snuck out" to see Wilson. The aforementioned video surveillance showed Armstrong pulling up to the apartment where Wilson was staying mere moments after Wilson was dropped off by Strickland.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Independent</a>, Wilson's friend returned to her apartment around 10 p.m. to find "Wilson lying on the bathroom floor covered in blood from multiple gunshot wounds." Said friend administered CPR until officers arrived but Wilson was pronounced dead on the scene. Wilson's friends and family were left shocked and devastated by her passing.</p><p>That same evening, when Strickland returned home to Armstrong, she "initiated sex" and "was rough and dominating," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a> reported.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Colin Strickland now?</h2><p>KVU investigative reporter Tony Plohetski <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted a statement from Strickland</a> about Wilson's murder, nine days after her death. "I am reeling from grieving Mo Wilson's death and from the facts that have emerged during the investigation," he said. "I cannot begin to imagine the pain felt by Mo's family and her close friends."</p><p>He went on to assure everyone he would cooperate fully with police and reiterated the strictly platonic nature of his relationship with Wilson.</p><p>Since Wilson's murder, various cycling sponsors have dropped Strickland, such as "component brand Enve Composites, bicycle company Specialized, and apparel brand Rapha," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Outside magazine</a>. Allied Cycle Works released a statement saying Strickland would not be representing them at future races. Although Strickland set his Instagram account to private following the incident, it's back up and contains mostly cycling-related content.</p><p>Although Strickland has not been charged in connection with Wilson's murder, police say he purchased guns in early 2022 because "every woman should own a gun," and gave one to Armstrong, per Fox News. That gun is now the alleged murder weapon in the case.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK6qwMuipWaZoqLAtb7Op55mpp%2Bs</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./this-is-totally-unacceptable-in-islam-ali-nuhu-cancels-davido-over-controversial-music-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'This Is Totally Unacceptable In Islam'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tay-k-47-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tay-K - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
