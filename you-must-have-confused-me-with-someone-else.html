"<strong>Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent</strong>" was the quote I've memorized to this day, and I think it comes in super handy whenever you have the undying itch to speak about something you have zero knowledge about.</p><p>And not to be all "now more than ever," but yea. Now, more than ever, it's kind of crucial to keep those German words in mind, so you don't end up making a complete fool out of yourself online or IRL for saying something patently and blatantly wrong. If you want to see what happens when people do the absolute opposite of following that wisdom, the subreddit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r/dontyouknowwhoiam</a> is a treasure trove.</p><p>Below, some of the best, most savage and hilarious burns for people who didn't figure out who they were talking to until it was much too late.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">1. You're pretty good at swimming...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>At least this stranger was offering a compliment &nbsp;ðŸ˜‚And it's worth even more because I hear swimmers in England aren't into cross-lane small talk.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2. Chairman Maf was just trying to help a fan out.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Also what is up with shutting people down with "Nobody cares." Am I getting old or are all online trolls the same 12-year-old antisocial boy?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">3. The Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave member showed this guy what was what.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>First of all, Rage Against the Machine was always about politics, so anyone saying Tom "instantly" woke up one day and cared is grossly misinformed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">4. Do my eyes deceive me?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>I never got into the franchise, but most of me thinks the author knows best. The other part of me agrees with u/<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>svaroz1c</u></a> who writes "I've lost all respect for J.K. Rowling as an author (and public figure). Ever since she got a Twitter, she can't seem to stop filling in details and making interpretations to books she released years ago, which many of her followers will unquestioningly accept as canon due to her authority as the original creator of the Harry Potter universe" on reddit. They continue, "A book should speak for itself and be 100% open to the interpretations and imaginations of its readers. Rowling is the equivalent of an overprotective helicopter parent to her books." Ok, true, true.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">5. This guy deserves a second PhD in Mansplaining.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>This arrogant guy must have gotten confused because Emily doesn't boast about her degree TWO times in her Twitter name, like he does.&nbsp;</p><p>P.S. If you're using "comma-PhD" after your name, we get it, you're a doctor.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">6. Should we try this again?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>Take it from the CEO, Softspace has a space. A soft space. But from the perspective of a copywriter, I think without a space is kind of, sort of better...</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">7. For as long as there are influencers, there probably will be mooches.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>Lately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">self-described influencers</a> have been driving the hospitality industry crazy. I get wanting a free vacation in exchange for posting photos of your glamorous life, but that's a whole different story. The bone I have to pick with this girl is that 3,000 isn't that many followers, and the "good deal" she's offering this club seems like a pretty objectively bad one, no matter where you're standing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">8. Unbreak my heart, GRRM!!! &lt;/3</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><p>If it's any comfort to the author of Game of Thrones (it won't be), this happens to writers all the time!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">9.

Wait UP â€” Women, like, know how... to teach?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Can I possibly roll my eyes further?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">11. The fact that he started with "As a Vietnam veteran," though.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>I don't understand what kind of urge would drive a person to have such a pressing need and desire to tell someone else off for expressing whatever menial thing they feel like sharing on the internet.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">12. u/kn0thing is Alexis Ohanian, founder of reddit, and Serena's husband</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>Turns out Alexis wasn't always too <a href=#>crazy about tennis</a>, though.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">13.
