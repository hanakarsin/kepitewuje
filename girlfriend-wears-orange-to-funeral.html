Sure, <a href=#>wearing white to a wedding</a> is generally considered to be pretty disrespectful, but what's more inconsiderate than causing a scene at someone's celebration of life — even worse, someone you don't know?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Funerals typically have a dress code of black, navy, or other dark, muted colors as a way to pay respect. However, some less traditional families choose to mourn while wearing bright and cheerful garb, or by donning the favorite color of the person who passed away.</p><p>TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@camillmatic</a>, or Cam, found herself in an uncomfortable situation after her boyfriend advised her to wear a neon orange sundress to a "non-traditional" funeral for a member of his family that she had never met. Let's get into it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Cam starts her video out with a staunch warning: "Do not trust men."</p><p>"I'm in town for a funeral," she explains. "It is my boyfriend's family's." Presumably the couple hasn't been dating long, because later in the video, she explains that his family doesn't know her that well.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"He told me, 'It's not a traditional funeral ... they want everybody to wear orange or bright colors,'" Cam continues. Though it's never specified why the color orange was singled out, Cam's boyfriend makes it clear that the plan for the funeral is for his family to coordinate to wear the summery shade.</p><p>Though Cam was reasonably skeptical, as orange isn't a typical funeral color and a social blunder like that could be a huge deal, her boyfriend reassured her that his family wasn't going the traditional funeral route: "He was like, 'It's a big thing, we're gonna have a huge cookout afterwards, so everybody's getting dressed up and wearing bright colors,' ... He told me specifically to wear this dress."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Therefore, Cam made the decision to travel into town for the funeral with her bright orange Anthropologie sundress packed in her bag (with no appropriate backup, which we'll ad-dress in a minute).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, it turns out that Cam should've listened to the dubious voice in her head, after all.</p><p>"I'm staying at my parents' house, he's staying at his parents' house," Cam said. "He called me this morning talking 'bout ... 'My mom's not wearing orange, and she doesn't know who else is wearing orange.'"</p><p>"So now," she backs up from the camera to show off the gorgeous-yet-completely-funeral-inappropriate dress, "I'm stuck like this going to somebody's funeral. Moral of the story: Don't trust men."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While many in the comments commiserated with her about their male partners' horrible communication skills, specifically when it comes to relaying information about gatherings, many were left to wonder — Why, if she was so unsure, didn't Cam pack a backup dress?</p><p>"Girl, please. You should have known to bring a backup outfit," one commenter expressed.</p><p>"Always overpack, sis, always!" shared another commenter as a word of wisdom.</p><p>In a later video, Cam shares that she did bring backup options, but they were all... orange. Talk about trusting your man.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the same follow-up video</a>, Cam explained what happened next, what she actually ended up wearing, and why exactly her boyfriend (who was being dragged through the dirt in her comments) seemingly tried to sabotage her in the first place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"OK, after further consideration," Cam shared, "he may not be all the way to blame. They *were* originally supposed to be wearing orange, but then I guess they just couldn't get it together in time, so people bailed out. He didn't get no update."</p><p>So, you may be wondering, did she show up to the funeral in her orange ensemble? Thankfully, no.</p><p>"My mother came and saved the day," she explained. "Thank God for mothers ... I pulled something from her closet. It didn't fit but we made it work, and I was not the laughing stock of his family for generations."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLazuMWroJ6mlGLEpq3RrGSoqpGjtKZ506hkn62emr%2BiuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./66996-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yoruba Actress, Toyin Aimakhu Is Pregnant (PHOTOS)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./afcon-2023-governor-obaseki-celebrates-super-eagles-1-0-win-over-ivory-coast.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Governor Obaseki Celebrates Super Eagles' 1-0 Win Over Ivory Coast</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
