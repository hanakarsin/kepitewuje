They also all got divorced.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>When news broke of Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin's lightning-fast engagement (after only two months of dating), the Internet groaned with cynicism. After all, the news came just weeks after Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson announced <a href=#>their whirlwind engagement</a> after only dating for a few weeks. Ariana even recently defended her relationship (and Justin's) after fans criticized the speed of her engagement.</p><p>“You do realize we are human beings who love and have lives… right?" she tweeted in a now-deleted response. "Love is lit. S--t happens. I hope to god it happens to you too. U deserve it."</p><p>And, sure, we understand love can be immediate and quick, but how successful are marriages with quick engagements? Judging by previous celebrity couples who rushed to the altar, the average length of these marriages is only <strong>2.5 years</strong>. Although we wish the best for Hailey and Justin, the stats don't lie.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, a look back at celebrity couples who were a little too quick to say, "I do."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries (Marriage Lasted: 72 Days)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: E!</span></figure><p>Kim's first marriage is one she probably would like to forget. After only dating for six months, the two got engaged and were on the cover of every tabloid. After milking their wedding for three months, their marriage ultimately only lasted 72 days. Honestly, we all saw it coming.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Khloé Kardashian and Lamar Odom (Marriage Lasted: 4 Years)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The Kardashians sure love their quickie engagements. Khloé met, got engaged, and married Lamar all within one month. They later split in 2013 after infidelity rumors. She's now dealing with the same issue with baby daddy Tristan Thompson. Looks like she can't get a break.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee (Marriage Lasted: 3 Years)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Hard to believe, considering they were an iconic couple of the late '90s, but Pamela and Tommy only knew each other for 96 hours before getting hitched. They had two sons and one infamous sex tape together, but they divorced only three years later.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Britney Spears and Kevin Federline (Marriage Lasted: 2 Years)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Oh boy, Britney's "K-Fed years" were infamous, complete with lots of barefoot trips to public bathrooms, Cheetos, and one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">horrible reality TV show</a>. But despite their tabloid romance, which involved getting married after only three months of dating, they divorced in 2006 after only two years of marriage. Since then, Britney has been in no rush to walk down the aisle again.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kaley Cuoco and Ryan Sweeting (Marriage Lasted: 2 Years)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>After a brief summer romance, these two lovebirds got engaged after only three months of dating and got married shortly after that. Although they laughed off breakup rumors, they filed for divorce in September 2015, just two years after getting engaged.&nbsp;</p><p>Kaley learned her lesson for her second trip down the aisle. She made her current hubby, Karl Cook, wait two years before getting hitched. Smart.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Renee Zellweger and Kenny Chesney&nbsp;(Marriage Lasted: 4 Months)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The Bridget Jones star met the country crooner at a tsunami relief benefit in January 2005. Four months later, they were tying the knot in a simple ceremony. However, their romance wouldn't last. They separated just four months later with Renee citing "fraud" as the reason for their split. The whole thing happened so quickly, most people don't even remember it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon (Marriage Lasted: 5 Years)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>After meeting each other on the set of Mariah's video for "Bye Bye," the two dated, got engaged, and got married within six weeks of knowing each other. However, after two kids and five years of marriage, they separated in 2014. Despite their irreconcilable differences, they remain on friendly terms for the sake of their children.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Avril Lavigne and&nbsp;Chad Kroeger (Marriage Lasted: 2 Years)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>They're both Canadian! They're rockers! It should've been a match made in heaven for these two lovebirds, but after getting engaged only six months after meeting, it was already off to a rough start. They tied the knot in 2013, but were on their way to splitsville just two years later. We guess marriage was too complicated for them.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Katy Perry and Russell Brand (Marriage Lasted: 14 Months)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Russell Brand and Katy Perry</p></figure><p>After meeting at the VMAs in 2009, the couple only dated for three months before Russell popped the question on New Year's Eve. After an elaborate wedding ceremony in India, the two seemed ready to take those "'til death do us part" vows seriously. Unfortunately, their marriage only lasted 14 months, with Russell filing for divorce in 2011.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes (Marriage Lasted: 6 Years)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The courtship between Katie and Tom (or TomKat as they were affectionately nicknamed) was a whirlwind of weird, complete with couch-jumping and Scientology <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wife interviews</a>. After only seven weeks of dating, the two got engaged in 2005 and married in 2006. They actually lasted a lot longer than people expected, but you can probably thank <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Xenu</a> for that.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">More from Distractify</h2><p><a href=#>The Internet Has Some Crazy Theories About Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson’s Relationship</a></p><p><a href=#>Justin Bieber Went Full Matthew McConaughey At Coachella And People Can't Stop Laughing</a></p><p><a href=#>Keeping Up With The Infidelities: Every Kardashian Cheating Scandal In Recent Memory&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZpb19mf3CflZCxameTmrmmrtGiq7JllpbAtXnEp56an5Wisq%2FA0g%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./423186-bbi-tension-paka-awasisimua-mawakili-mahakamani-huku-tumbo-joto-la-bbi-likitesa-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BBI Tension: Paka Awasisimua Mawakili Mahakamani Huku Tumbo Joto la BBI Likitesa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lebron-james-high-school-coach.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>LeBron James's High School Coach Keith Dambrot Wasn't Easy</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
