However, that couldn't be further from the truth.</p><p>According to the historic prison's website, the prison is still very much in operation. It reads: "Sing Sing Correctional Facility is a maximum security prison operated by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision in Ossining, New York. It houses about 1,700 incarcerated people and is located about 30 miles north of New York City on the bank of the Hudson River."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The article on the penitentiary adds that the location has been wrongly maligned due to its past: "Sing Sing's almost 200 year history earned it a worldwide reputation as a notorious prison, but it is unfair to recognize it only for those reasons."</p><p>It continued to say that despite its history, the facilities at Sing Sing today have distanced it from that sordid past: "Today, Sing Sing is considered a model correctional facility with its innovative rehabilitation programs for the incarcerated."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here's my review of the powerful SING SING - this movie is a rare and special artifact made with deep care and thoughtfulness.

When I think about Prison, I associate it with structure, security, discipline, education, vocation and families."</p><p>Capra went on to state that Sing Sing's primary function is to help rehabilitate folks and that he is wholly dedicated to ensuring the facility's prisoners are afforded that chance: "I spend many hours thinking about putting 1,700 broken pieces back together so when they leave this place they will be prepared to be productive, educated, confident, employed,‚Äãcrime-free people.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Joan Baez and her sister Mimi Fari√±a perform at Sing Sing Prison.<br>They were the opening act for B.B.

Recidivism is New York is roughly 42 percent, but when an inmate receives a college degree while incarcerated, that number drops to 4 percent. That‚Äôs why Capra encourages his wards to get an education," the outlet wrote.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here with the great Wayne Kramer outside Sing Sing Prison in 2009 getting ready to discuss recovery with prisoners, then perform a concert.
