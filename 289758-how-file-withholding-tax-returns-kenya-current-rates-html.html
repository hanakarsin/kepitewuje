The agency introduced the <a href=#>iTax</a> system a few years ago to enable the taxpayers to carry out the transactions online without visiting the KRA offices.</p><h2>What is withholding tax?</h2><p class=align-left>Withholding tax, alternatively called retention tax, is a standard income tax paid to the state by the income payer in place of the income receiver. In simple terms, this tax is deducted or withheld from the recipient's income before its disbursement. Besides employment tax, some jurisdictions levy withholding tax on payments of dividends and interest.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/dd70d43637817ee0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A guide on how to pay advance tax on iTax Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>KRA</a> withholding tax on interest income payments is usually fixed.

The Withholder is the person who is making payment and withholds some money to remit to the taxman, while the withholder is the recipient of the income being withheld.</p><p class=align-left>Kenya Revenue Authority expects to receive all the withheld income taxes before the end of the 20th day of the consequent month.

Do not click on the "Return" tab.</li><li>The system will avail an "e-Payment registration form" pre-filled with your company information.</li><li>Fill in the "Tax Head" by clicking the drop-down menu and selecting "Income Tax" from the list. The company is reporting another person's tax; hence it is called income tax. Also, verify that "(0105) Income Tax – Withholding" is the "Tax Sub Head."</li><li>Choose between two options available to return withholding tax. First, using Excel, which is recommended when filing returns for multiple consultants to shun away from WebForms filled one at a time. Second, you can opt to stick with independent WebForms.</li><li>The "Excel upload" option requires one to download and fill an excel sheet which you then save, validate, and upload through iTax using the upload button.</li><li>For the "Web Form" option, proceed to choose the nature of the transaction from a drop-down list provided.

Late payments of withholding tax attract overwhelming penalties, which stretch to thousands of shillings.</p><p class=align-left>Currently, KRA charges a penalty of 20,000 or 5 percent of the payable fee, whichever is higher of the two. The withholder must pay all withholding tax on behalf of the supplier in cases of forgetfulness when declaring withholding tax or failure to comply with the Withholding Tax Act.</p><h2>Calculate withholding tax on invoice in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>When a taxpayer (trader) supplies and invoices an appointed withholding VAT Agent, the payment for supply is made less VAT charged or that which ought to have been charged. In Kenya, the agents deduct 2% of the VAT and remit it to KRA. The remaining balance of 14% is paid to the supplier.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhsaujsetjion4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=#><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does iTax mean?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/46c4c8591381473f.jpeg><p class=align-left>In this case, the supplier has a lower tax burden since 2% of the VAT due has already been remitted to KRA on their behalf. Once the 2% withholding VAT is remitted via the iTax portal, the acknowledgement receipt or certificate is sent to the supplier. It is important to note that the withholding tax on invoice should be remitted to KRA within 14 days of deducting the VAT.</p><p class=align-left>With this comprehensive piece on how to file withholding tax returns in Kenya, you should file your returns, make payments, and generate the certificate with ease.
