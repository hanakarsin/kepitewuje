I want to sincerely commend him for openly supporting the South-East geo-political zone to produce the next President of Nigeria.</p><p>It is imperative I remind him that I didn’t betray my people, rather I am doing my best to reintegrate them into mainstream politics,” the statement opened.</p><p>Kalu added that “in the last two years, I have been at the forefront agitating for a Nigerian President of South-East extraction, when most of them were all saying “Southern Presidency”. None of these actors openly said the South-East geo-political zone should have it. I was shocked that even the zone the entire South-East supported in unity including myself in 2011 and 2015 respectively, has the highest number of contestants without thinking of their brothers, knowing fully well that the South East zone has remained the only zone in Southern Nigeria that has not produced the nation’s president since the rotation convention dispensation that began in 1999.</p><p>Coming to this late hour to support the South East is rather suspicious to me if they couldn’t do it two years ago. The truth is, Chief Edwin Clark knows the South-East cannot get the ticket of any party in an open contest as it is today without a gentleman agreement to concede it to the South-East.</p><p>If all the aspirants from the South-West and South-South cannot support their brothers from the South-East, It is only politically correct to support the North-East geo-political zone, which to me is the shortest route for the South-East geo-political zone to produce the president after their 8 years instead of waiting for another 16 years.”</p><p>The Abia Senator wondered why Clark has singled him out for criticism but has not deemed it fit to challenge those who have openly worked against the move for a southern/southeast President to emerge in 2023.</p><p>“It is rather surprising to me that Chief Edwin Clark didn’t call the majority of other Southerners including governors working against the South-East to order or the names he called me.</p><p>What did you say or do when all the aspirants from South South and South West were buying forms to run against South Easterners who have always supported them .</p><p>I know some people want us to keep quiet and then allow other Southerners take turn of South East. If you meant well for the South East , you could have discouraged other aspirants against running for President. Nothing stops the South supporting only presidential aspirants from the South East . The betrayers are those who don’t care about South East . We are wiser.</p><p>Let me also inform the elderstatesman that majority of the Southerners in his party (PDP) are secretly supporting a Northeasterner to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari,” he said.</p><p>The Senator maintained that he did not betray the Igbo people by dropping his 2023 presidential ambition neither does he have any plan to betray them in the future, adding that he has lost his personal business defending the people of the region and has no personal glory to seek.</p><p>“The welfare of my people is a passion that is driving me, I am not doing anything to advance my personal interest or seek personal glorification. I also lost my businesses fighting for the political interest of the Igbos. I cannot betray them now if I didn’t do it yesterday,” Kalu submitted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5BrZrKnpWKvpsDRmrCenF2ptaZ50qisraCVlsC1edaeZJqqlWLEqr%2FEq2SkmZyqeqe10Z6qZpqRmLhurdNmnJ2vmaN6pLjAq6Jo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./428848-eric-omondi-afichua-kwamba-mamake-alisikitika-baada-ya-kusikia-amejiingiza-siasani-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eric Omondi Afichua Kwamba Mamake Alisikitika Baada ya Kusikia Amejiingiza Siasani</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-mizanin-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Miz - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
