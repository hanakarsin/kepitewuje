PAUL/YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is going on now with Darrell Brooks's trial?</h2><p>On Oct. 25, 2022, Judge Jennifer R. Dorow read a set of finalized jury instructions that took most of the afternoon to get through. This came in the form of a 107-page document outlining juror conduct in reaching a verdict and reminding them that they must consider each of the 76 charges individually. Throughout this time, Brooks repeatedly interrupted and mentioned his first amendment rights multiple times.</p><p>Due to his repeated interruptions, Judge Dorow decided to send Brooks to adjacent courtrooms multiple times, which delayed the trial even further.</p><p>When Brooks returned, Judge Dorow accused him of throwing away the 107-page jury document. Later on, she granted him a separate hearing which was a result of his concerns regarding immediate sentencing, pending his conviction.</p><p>When Brooks delivered his closing arguments in the case, he said he was speaking "from the heart."</p><p>"For a year, I have sat while going through this," he said. "I understand about healing myself, tragedy and pain."</p><p>He seemed to have recognized that he was the one piloting the vehicle through the parade that day, but maintained that he didn't intend to inflict harm and was honking his horn at parade-goers.</p><p>Waukesha County District Attorney Sue Opper disagreed, saying "When you ride through a parade route and roll over children, ... your intent is known, Mr. Brooks. You don't have to stand and wonder, as he claims to. ... There are 68 victims in this case. That's not an accident."</p><p>The jury is still actively deliberating the case, but a verdict is expected to be reached soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6zvsSlo2aaoqS8rL%2BMnJ%2BaqpeawA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./buhari-breaks-silence-on-umahis-defection-to-apc-tells-him-what-to-do.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Buhari Breaks Silence On Umahi's Defection To APC, Tells Him What To Do</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-the-tiny-food-fight-food-real.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Food on 'Tiny Food Fight' Will Leave the Judges Hungry for More Literally</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
