The singer is incredibly close with his parents, Mark and Carole Capaldi.</h2><p>On Oct. 7, 1996, Lewis was born to parents Mark and Carole Capaldi in Glasgow, Scotland. When the “Someone You Loved” singer was four, his parents moved to Bathgate — located in Scotland’s western lowlands — where they still reside.</p><p>Not only that, but Lewis lived in his childhood home in his early twenties (despite his widespread success as a musician). "I've had the same bedroom since I was 10 years old!” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote on his Instagram story</a> in 2020. “I've got f—ing New York wallpaper.”</p><p>In the trailer for his new documentary How I’m Feeling Now, Lewis’s mom revealed just how close their relationship truly is. "You’ve still got a lot of growing up to do. You need to phone your mother to come and pick you up from your one-night stand,” she told her son. “Because you're having a panic attack."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What do Lewis Capaldi’s parents do for a living? Lewis almost followed in his father’s footsteps.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Lewis’s parents' career paths couldn’t be more different. The “Pointless” singer’s mother, Carole, works as a nurse, while his father, Mark, is a successful fishmonger. When speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mirror</a> in 2020, the 26-year-old admitted he’d probably enter his dad’s profession had music not worked out.</p><p>“My dad is a fishmonger. He has a fish shop. One that sells fresh fish — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KP’s Fresh Fish</a>,” Lewis explained. “So I’d probably work there. But I hate fish. I hate the smell of fish. And I can’t look at prawns in the face.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Lewis Capaldi have any siblings? The ‘How I’m Feeling Now’ star has two brothers and one sister.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Lewis is the baby of the family! The Scottish singer is the youngest of four Capaldi children. His oldest brother, Warren, introduced Lewis to music when he was growing up; the two were both interested in playing guitar as adolescents.</p><p>Lewis’s other older brother Anthony, 28, is also a lover of the arts, currently working as an actor. He starred in the BBC Scotland film Haggis in 2020.</p><p>The singer’s sister, Danielle, 30, works as a midwife in Scotland and frequently posts about her relationship with her brother on social media. On TikTok, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danielle posted a video</a> comparing her and Lewis’s uncanny physical resemblance. “His fans did me dirty,” she wrote, followed by a crying emoji.</p><p>Stream Lewis Capaldi’s new documentary How I’m Feeling Now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobK4tdJmmpqokaGxqnnPmqmepqSo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ric-flair-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ric Flair - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-yahaya-bello-camp-reacts-as-tinubu-declares-presidential-bid.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yahaya Bello Camp Reacts As Tinubu Declares Presidential Bid</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
