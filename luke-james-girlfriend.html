She shared the news on her Instagram with a photo of the two of them. "My first ever official #mcm üòç" she captioned the post. "My man. My crush. My Monday morning. So it's only right. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@wolfjames</a>."</p><p>When Jessie J decided to share that she was in a relationship with Luke for the first time in December 2014, she was asked about her decision to go public with the information.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/J4uajT1c3/0x0/luke-james-1584463268361.jpg><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"You go through so many different kinds of love growing up," she said on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Daytime.</a> "I feel like at this time in my life ‚Äî&nbsp;I'm nearly 27, I'm a grown woman, and I'm famous, and I have to deal with that and I would rather take control of it. So going public, it was like I love him, so why hide it or try to be a secret?"</p><p>Only 10 months later, Jessie made the decision to call it off with Luke, for fear that he was using her to keep his own career in the spotlight. At the time, Jessie was rapidly gaining popularity, while Luke was still new to the music scene.</p><p>"Jessie fell hard for Luke, but over the summer she started having doubts," a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun </a>at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to their breakup, Jessie went on a Twitter rant.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything from you," she tweeted.
