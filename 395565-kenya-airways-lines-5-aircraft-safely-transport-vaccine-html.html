However, the vaccines will be loaded into either special aircraft containers (envirotainers) which are then loaded into the aircraft (active containers). Other alternatives are having the vaccines in cool boxes with dry ice. These will be the primary temperature management elements. The aircraft controls come as secondary elements. These are considerations to be done by the pharmaceutical shippers dependent on the destination of vaccines. Important to note is that there are vaccines like from AstraZeneca (2-8 degrees) which can be managed using the second temperature control setting ranges available in our aircraft without using cool boxes with dry ice or envirotainers. In all cases, the KQ infrastructure, both on-air and the ground will heavily support the transport and handling logistics. It could also be a possibility that the vaccines distributed across the Africa continent will be more of the type with lesser extreme temperature conditions," Musola explained.<p class=align-left>As separately reported by <strong>TUKO.co.ke</strong>, KQ has already <a href=#>set up a modern Pharma Cargo facility</a> with temperature controls that is able to hold at least 300 tons of pharmaceutical products that are temperature sensitive.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> <a href=#>Click 'See First' under 'Follow' Tab to see Tuko.co.ke news on your FB Feed</a></p><p class=align-left>KQ's move to step up its special cargo holding facility came at a time when dozens of airlines and other logistic companies across the world are in a race to prepare to transport vaccines.</p><p class=align-left>Section of freighters across the globe have fitted their cabins with special cooling equipment in a move to tap into the vaccine freighting market.</p><p class=align-left>The UK is among countries that have already started vaccinating their populations.</p><p class=align-left>Vaccination kicked off on Tuesday, December 8, and <a href=#>a 90-year-old woman</a> was the first to receive the Pfizer jab that was <a href=#>recently approved</a> by Prime Minister Boris Johson-led administration.</p><p class=align-left>Russian authorities started a mass rollout of Sputnik V vaccine on Saturday, December 5, while China, which has at least two approved doses, has sent consignments to Indonesia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/a31395e702bd0b1d.jpeg><p class=align-left>On Thursday, December 10, the US is set to decide the fate of Pfizer dose which has filed for emergency use.
