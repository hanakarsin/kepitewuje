Or at least the idea of it. Reality TV shows relish turning the pursuit of the greatest human emotion into a debased competition where everyone's pretending to be in the game for a noble cause.</p><p>But people tune in regardless, and it helps when there are at least some likable personalities on the show, like Vinny and <a href=#>Pauly D</a> on <a href=#>Double Shot at Love</a>. And fans of the <a href=#>Jersey Shore</a> OG cast members want to know: Who does Vinny pick on Double Shot at Love?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who does Vinny pick on 'Double Shot at Love'?</h2><p>If you aren't familiar with the premise of the show, it features the two Italian-American TV personalities who made a living off of allowing TV cameras to chronicle their escapades living on the Jersey Shore. They navigate relationships, get into bar fights, work out, chill in hot tubs, and party with their particular brand of Garden State enthusiasm.</p><p>Well, Vinny's from Staten Island, New York, which is unofficially a suburb of New Jersey, and he's vying alongside his castmate DJ Pauly D to find the love of his life. The show is currently in its third season.</p><p>So we don't know who Vinny ends up with in Season 3 because, as of this writing, it's still going on. Pauly previously found love with <a href=#>Nikki Hall</a> in the show, so although he's along for the ride, he's not looking for another significant other. He and Nikki are wing-man-and-womaning it for their bro.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>‚ÄúDescribe yourself in five words.‚Äù<br>Me: <a href=#>#DoubleShotAtLove</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MXqFD8zBcu</a></p>‚Äî A Double Shot At Love (@MTVShotAtLove) <a href=#>September 17, 2021</a></figure><p>At the end of A Double Shot at Love Season 1, Vinny was torn between two women: Elle Wilson from Pennsylvania and Alysse Joyner out of Brooklyn, NY. Vinny ultimately selected Alysse, but the two didn't last.</p><p>During the second season, it looked like there was a strong possibility that Vinny would end up with Maria Elizondo, but the sad-eyed Jersey Shore cast member ultimately decided he couldn't commit to her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not them knowing each other!!! üòÆ <a href=#>#DoubleShotAtLove</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/npM4vUtMW8</a></p>‚Äî A Double Shot At Love (@MTVShotAtLove) <a href=#>September 17, 2021</a></figure><p>He admitted that they didn't have a clean break up, but their on-again-off-again relationship clearly didn't persist into Season 3.

It at least suggests that there's a certain authentic pursuit of love in this reality dating show. Or maybe she left for another TV gig and production spun it that way.</p><p>Whatever the reason, you can watch new episodes Friday nights at 9 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecOonKxlpp67r8WMqaCco12ku26wzq6ZpZ1dqLWwwIyaq2akn6uy</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./endsars-protesters-stole-2m-n17m-from-me-oba-akiolu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'#EndSARS Protesters' Stole $2m, N17m From Me</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nigerian-rapper-ruggedman-loses-father.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerian Rapper, Ruggedman Loses Father</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
