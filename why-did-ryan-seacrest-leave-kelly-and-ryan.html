Ryan has stretched himself thin across multiple hosting gigs for more than a decade. He started his career on <a href=#>American Idol</a> and has been very successful.</p><p>Fans were left wondering what led to Ryan's exit and what he's been up to since leaving. Here's what we know about why he left and what he has planned for the future.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Ryan Seacrest leave 'Live With Kelly and Ryan'?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Live with Kelly and Mark Facebook</a><p>Ryan Seacrest toasting to the end of his run on 'Live With Kelly and Ryan' with his parents and sister.</p></figure><p>Having been the longtime host of American Idol, radio shows On Air with Ryan Seacrest and American Top 40, and <a href=#>Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve</a>, Ryan has an incredible hosting resume. But when he first started on Live, the "Host Chat" segments posed a new challenge: finding hobbies, or generally speaking, a life outside of work.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Ryan credits six seasons at Live with helping him evolve as a broadcaster. He said, “I’ve become more comfortable letting things just happen without thinking about what has to come next. Because it can really go in any direction.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ryan Seacrest was supposed to only do three years of 'Live With Kelly and Ryan.'</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)</a></p></figure><p>What was initially supposed to be a three-year run turned into six years on Live With Kelly and Ryan. Ryan enjoyed working with co-host <a href=#>Kelly Ripa</a> and their crew. He told Variety, "With each year that went by, I continued to extend my contract because I love sitting next to my partner and having this unique and casual connection to the people that watch.”</p><p>Ryan's addition to Live led to the show consistently performing well in ratings. By his second to last week on the show, they celebrated 29 consecutive weeks as the No. 1 syndicated talk show in America. The show has topped the Nielsen ratings for three consecutive years.</p><p>The show's success has even led Kelly and Ryan to win Daytime Emmys in 2019 for outstanding hosting.</p><p>But after the fourth year, Ryan confided in Kelly about potentially leaving the show. On April 14, 2023, Ryan left the show with a send-off of his greatest moments that included an iconic clip of him declaring, “The winner of American Idol is Kelly Clarkson,” in the Dolby Theatre.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Ryan Seacrest doing now?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@ryanseacrest</a></figure><p>First and foremost, <a href=#>Ryan will still be hosting American Idol</a>, but he also has other plans and goals too.</p><p>A foodie at heart, Ryan plans to dive into the culinary world. Ryan always had a plan B in case his first plan as a broadcaster failed. He told Variety, "My fallback plan was to be a chef, to be around food and learn how to do it well."</p><p>He continued, "I was very much into the performance aspect of how a kitchen worked, and how it was served. It was like backstage and onstage.”</p><p>His ongoing love and curiosity for cooking led to him starting an organic olive oil and wine label called, Concento.</p><p>“I’ve just found so much joy and fun in doing it,” Seacrest explains. “Dovetailing from it will be ideas for shows and programs, as well.”</p><p>Whatever Ryan chooses to do in the future, we have no doubt that he will be successful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aqqZa7br%2FEmpqrnaOpeq2xwK%2BcZqOVobm6ecCnm2aqqZa7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./georgina-onuoha-reacts-to-tontos-leaked-audio-reveals-why-people-should-avoid-kpokpogri.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Georgina Onuoha Reacts To Tonto's Leaked Audio, Reveals Why People Should Avoid Kpokpogri</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kenny-redneck-tv-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kenny Redneck Tv - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
