He will fade out. So that’s the position,’’ he declared.</p><p>He went on to share his thoughts on how the 2023 election would be won.</p><p>“We are not really troubled about whatever people perceive as happening. We are strong in the South West; everybody should know that; that is the home base of our presidential candidate. Whatever happened in Osun State was a local issue. Probably the people didn’t want the government to come back, but it’s going to be a different ball game in the presidential election; we are very certain of that.”</p><p>He insisted that APC had made great leaps in the South East and South-South, hence his believe that they would defeat Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar.</p><p>“We are making inroads into the South East. Don’t forget that there are two APC states in the South East. If the people decide to follow the ‘Obedients’ or the PDP, we are sure that we are going to win, at least the minimum votes in Ebonyi and Imo states. Which is a very good one. That’s what we are projecting,” he added.</p><p>Speaking further, he stated that Delta, Edo and Rivers were strong APC allies.</p><p>Speaking on the ruling party chances in the north, he argued that North central and North West belong to them adding that Obidients does not stand a chance in those territories.</p><p>“Don’t forget that our Vice Presidential candidate comes from the North East region where Atiku comes from. We already believed that we have at least two states in our pocket: Borno and Yobe. And we are going to make a lot of incursions in other states, including Adamawa state, where Atiku hails from.</p><p>‘’So we are going to win this election, hands down. We are going to beat Atiku, and he knows we are going to beat him,’’ he noted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49xZqiamWK2tHnAZqqom5mWuW65xJ2gmmWjmru0rdOipqdlmJp6uLXLpWSsp5%2Bjeqetw55kqK2kYryvrc2unppn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./297066-watu-2-wajeruhiwa-kwenye-mlipuko-nairobi-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watu 2 wajeruhiwa kwenye mlipuko Nairobi</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ivory-coast-vs-nigeria-make-or-mar-2023-afcon-clash-for-super-eagles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Make Or Mar 2023 AFCON Clash For Super Eagles</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
