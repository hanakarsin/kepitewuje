The popular ongoing reality series on <a href=#>Bravo</a> follows the titular Lisa Vanderpump as she and the staff members at her many restaurants in West Hollywood strive for greatness in their careers as they deal with all of the drama and conflict that reality show fans have come to expect. As cast members come and go, we get a glimpse into their glamorous lives.</p><p>One of the people we've gotten to know over a decade is <a href=#>James Kennedy</a>. He originally appeared on the series as a guest cast member in Season 2. By Season 4, he has long been a staple in the Vanderpump Rules cast and has amassed an enviable fortune as a result. As one might expect, his appearances on the show as a main cast member have helped him establish a considerable net worth. But how much is James Kennedy currently worth? Keep reading for all of the details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">James Kennedy has built a substantial net worth thanks to 'Vanderpump Rules.'</h2><p>James was originally hired as a busboy for SUR Restaurant and Lounge, which is perhaps the most prominent of the restaurants featured on Vanderpump Rules. He quickly gained prominence on the show as a series regular and has used that popularity to propel his own ventures. His official bio on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bravo site</a> even lists him as the "#1 guy in the group," whatever that means. As of this writing, he currently lives in a house with his girlfriend, Ally Lewber.</p><p>According to outlets like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sportskeeda Pop</a>, James's net worth currently stands at a staggering $4 million. Reportedly, he makes between $10,000 to $15,000 per episode of Vanderpump Rules.
