Moreover, these people feel like Romeo and Juliet, who found one love for their entire life. They escape and get married secretly, breaking the prohibitions.</p><h4>Lack of sexual education and unexpected pregnancy</h4><p class=align-left>Young people are not always educated enough on sexual relationships and methods to avoid unplanned pregnancies.</p><p class=align-left>Most countries prohibit abortions. Furthermore, they bear criminal liability under the law. To prevent legal responsibility and punishment, young people are obliged to get married, even if one of the "participants" is considered too young.</p><h4>Early marriage as a tribute to ancestors</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4e41500687c7cfaa.jpg><p class=align-left>Keeping traditions preserved is one of the primary tasks in many <a href=#>African countries</a>.

Parents may also get their children engaged in building strong relationships between clans or powerful families.</p><h3>What are the effects of early marriage in our society?</h3><p class=align-left>In most cases, early marriages are not good for both sides of the relationship. However, the main negative influence falls on the young girls married off at tender ages. Below are some of the major problems of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">child marriage.</a></p><h4>Lack of education</h4><p class=align-left>In most cultures, the primary "function" of a girl or a woman is to give birth to children and run the house. Such a necessary feature as <a href=#>education</a> is thought to be unnecessary for them. The girls are detached from educational establishments and are obliged to be good wives. They are forbidden to have even the slightest idea to continue studying.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a0aae168f98360d6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most popular types of family</span></p></a><h4>Great refusal</h4><p class=align-left>Even if a woman is finally allowed to continue her formal education, she often faces another difficulty – a refusal to be accepted back. The only answer to her "Why?" is that she is already a wife and a mother of a child she should take care of.</p><h4>Being in a trap</h4><p class=align-left>As a result, these girls find themselves being in a trap: on the one hand, they have to work to earn a living, but from another hand – a lack of education and necessary skills doesn't provide enough opportunities for well-paid jobs. That's why their life turns into a "circle of survival" with no beginning and no end.</p><h4>Easy to contract diseases</h4><p class=align-left>Children who are married off are also more likely to get s*xually transmitted illnesses like HIV. Most of them are quite young and have little understanding about STIs and unexpected pregnancy, as well as how to protect themselves from such infections.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/eb606e8f59a57872.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 5 causes of the current religious crisis in Nigeria and possible solutions</span></p></a><h4>Emotional adversity</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4c1e8353bf65a57b.jpg><p class=align-left>From early years, families force their children to do something that contradicts their wishes and aims. The young "brides" are not given a choice and are <a href=#>involved in relationships</a> without a feeling of love.</p><p class=align-left>As a result, the emotional state of girls becomes slightly unstable. She is not mature enough mentally to cope with all the difficulties and questions in her mind.</p><p class=align-left>They find only two ways out – commit su*cide or run away with the kids from their husbands to some distant relatives. This leads to social renunciation and shame put on her family. Moreover, they still stay face-to-face with their difficulties with no help.</p><h4>Physical immaturity and health issues</h4><p class=align-left>It has been proved that the female body is formed only by 18 years to reproduce the offspring. An unformed body cannot provide the fetus with proper conditions and normal development. Moreover, one observes the highest mortality rate among newborns and women in families with early marriage.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/86f2800cff482225.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 9 examples of gender inequality in the society and their causes</span></p></a><h4>No friends and loneliness</h4><p class=align-left>After marriage, many young girls get separated from society (especially if she moves into a new place of residence) and focus on their families and household duties.</p><h4>No social support and proper medical care</h4><p class=align-left>The rights and needs of women are thought to be of almost no importance if compared to men's. They do not get enough medical care services, social support, and improved working conditions.</p><h4>Young and physically productive</h4><p class=align-left>In developing countries, the problem of early marriage is followed by higher productivity. The younger a girl is, the more children she can give birth to. Also, in some tribal communities, it is a tradition to have many children.</p><p class=align-left>Furthermore, some of these social structures give preference to boys as to the continuers of the family. As a result, a couple produces more children to "reach the goal". Possessing too many children is the key cause of "overpopulation" worldwide.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e1ff40210b2b5f14.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Unhealthy marriage practices in Nigeria</span></p></a><h4>High level of poverty</h4><p class=align-left>Young people breed more children. Social conditions do not provide well-paid jobs. As a result, parents do not have enough money to make their children educated. No education means low-paid positions or no job at all. The more unemployed people, the higher the poverty level is observed within a country.</p><h3>What are the best solutions to end early marriages?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fcb6f6becd15c242.jpeg><p class=align-left>Girls are particularly impacted by child marriage because it frequently results from pervasive gender inequity.
