If I were to be in his shoes, I will weigh my options and ask myself, if I resign, will it increase the chances of the party in the election? If my resignation will enhance the chances of the party in the election, I will not wait a second before resigning,” he maintained.</p><p>Citing that if people asked him to drop his House of Representatives ticket for an easy win of the presidential election, then he won’t hesitate.</p><p>Olayinka advised electorates to consider antecedents of both political parties and their candidates to make informed choices.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49sZp%2BnoqKys3nZqKWapF2ovbC3xKynnqqjpLtuv8CyqmaolKV6qr%2BMq5ysp5yrtq%2BzjKKrrGWTp7a0tdJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-dexter-based-on-a-true-story.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Dexter Based on a True Story?
