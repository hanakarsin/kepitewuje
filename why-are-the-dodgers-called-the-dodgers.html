As of now, the legendary baseball franchise is leading the National League West with 21 wins and 12 losses ... that's pretty impressive.</p><p>Now, we could go on and on about the team's incredible season, but there's other business we must attend to (particularly the origin of the club's name). So, why are the Dodgers called the Dodgers? Here's everything we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why are the Dodgers called the Dodgers?</h2><p>We're here to answer one of the MLB community's most burning questions: "Why are the Dodgers called the Dodgers?"</p><p>The franchise's history goes way back, with the team established as the Brooklyn Atlantics in 1883. The team was known by several other monikers, including the Bridegrooms, Grooms, Superbas, Robins, and, eventually, the Trolley Dodgers.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MLB</a>, the name Trolley Dodgers became official in 1896; back then, "heavy construction of electric trolley tracks in front of Eastern Park caused fans to dodge the trolleys to reach the park." As a result, "those fans became known as Trolley Dodgers, and the team took on the name, which was shortened to Dodgers."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Los Angeles Dodgers (@dodgers)</a></p></figure><p>Although the Trolley Dodgers nickname stuck and was used heavily throughout this period, it didn't appear on the team's uniform until 1933. Per the MLB, once the franchise relocated from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, the Dodgers name moved with them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The electric trolley terrified many Brooklyn pedestrians.</h2><p>In May 2007, Joseph P. Sullivan published a piece titled "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The terror of the trolley</a>" in the Journal of Urban Technology.</p><p>The author claimed that the electric trolley is "an object of nostalgic affection" in the present day. While some are thrilled to see the vehicles roll down the street now, it wasn't always sunshines and rainbows.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ah, the Trolley Dodgers…now it makes sense <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LdFhQamxnZ</a></p>— Dave Marek (@dmarek94) <a href=#>February 6, 2022</a></figure><p>"In the 1890s, the electric trolley terrified many New Yorkers. The electric streetcar was much faster than a horse streetcar and caused many accidents," Joseph stated. "In Brooklyn especially, the trolley frequently killed or maimed young children. As a result, the electric trolley became a symbol of the chaotic nature of modern, urban life."</p><p>Additionally, he revealed that by 1895, "the trolley had killed 107 people and injured about 450." He added it "became an exemplar of random death," noting that "the explorer R.E. Peary said he thought the Brooklyn trolley as dangerous as an Arctic expedition."</p><p>"A restaurant keeper in Yellowstone Park told his guests that he had left Brooklyn and fled to the West only after the trolley had killed his family," Joseph continued. "The team, like the Yellowstone restaurant keeper, eventually deserted Brooklyn but kept its history in its new name — the Los Angeles Dodgers."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Los Angeles Dodgers (@dodgers)</a></p></figure><p>We don't know about you, but we just learned a lot. Though these trolleys were incredibly detrimental to New York's previous preferred transportation, we hope the team and the MLB community continues to honor those who lost their lives to them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecCrnGasmJp6pbvDoJyrq12Yrq24xJ1kraCVYrGwsMaeqaw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./exclusive-victor-osimhen-not-yet-cleared-to-play-against-south-africa.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Victor Osimhen Not Yet Cleared To Play Against South Africa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
