We are doing well, we are healthy, we are making money and we will continue to elevate.</p><p>“And for the record, no one gave me any stinking money for an abortion. As a mother, when you carry a child and deliver her by the Grace of God, you will know how insulting this is and has been.</p><p>“At the time those nonsense stories came out, I chose to focus on delivering my child since I had a high-risk pregnancy and a fibroid that practically exploded a few months in. But as she is safe and sound now, there’s no pressure. We thank God.”</p><h2>Alleged Relationship Between Maria and Olamide</h2><p>In 2019, the story of an alleged relationship between the MTV Shuga actress and Olamide began to make the rounds on social media.</p><p>A report from Thisdaylive had stated that Maria had become entangled with Olamide with the belief that he had broken up with his long-time partner and babymama.</p><p>However, the relationship between the duo went sour after Maria found out that the YBNL boss was still with his baby mama.</p><p>Maria later found out she was pregnant and reached out to Olamide <a href=#>to discuss their options and he reportedly said that the decision was hers and planned to co-parent with her.</a></p><p>She decided to keep the baby and move to London but things seemed to have gone awry between her and the child’s father as she later revealed that she was solely responsible for her daughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49vZqikkaK2pbHSZpmamqmirq6tjKaYq6GRYsCxscCkqmannmKurbjEoJydZZ5neq61y6WgqKZdm7%2BwuYysoKeflad6tbuMnKampZmpeqKuzquroqeeZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./survivor-season-43-cast.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>CBS Has Spoken!
