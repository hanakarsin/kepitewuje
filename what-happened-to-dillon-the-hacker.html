The YouTuber garnered fame with videos that saw him launch attacks on many YouTube celebrities. Where is he now?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Youtube</span></figure><p>Dillon the Hacker (Dillon Prescott Henderson) obtained an enormous social media following by playing tricks on established content creators like PewDiePie, James Charles, and Jenna Marbles.</p><p>Many have fallen for his mock smear campaigns, including Markiplier, a fellow gamer who ventured so far as to sue him for defamation. Dillon disappeared from YouTube shortly after the first news about the court case had emerged. Some now claim that he has passed away.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What happened to Dillon the Hacker?&nbsp;</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what happened to Dillon the Hacker?&nbsp;</h2><p>Dillon the Hacker was one of the most controversial YouTubers out there. He earned renown for his ruthless attacks on just about every YouTube celebrity.&nbsp;</p><p>This highly unconventional strategy yielded to unexpected success, and in a few years' time, his vitriolic pieces were watched by as many as hundreds of thousands of subscribers.&nbsp;At the height of his career, Dillon was hailed as PewDiePie's most-dreaded nemesis.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Youtube</span></figure><p>However, Dillon's most-watched publicity stunt involved another gamer.&nbsp;</p><p>With the video titled "What Markiplier is like in REAL LIFE *When Not Recording Games*," Dillon took a firm stance against the popular gamer.&nbsp;</p><p>As Dillon reasoned in the piece, Markiplier was undeserving of fame because he disrespected Jimmy Kimmel, acted inconsiderately towards a wheelchair user in the past, and regularly mocked his fans.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn't take Markiplier long to respond — and he took Dillon to court for defamation.&nbsp;</p><p>Dillon vanished from the social media platform soon after first word about the court case got out.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, most believed that the two events were strongly correlated to each other — and that he saw it best to abruptly quit after he became embroiled in a legal dispute.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as a tweet posted by PewDiePie reveals, there was much more at stake.&nbsp;</p><p>"Dillon the hacker was such a talented young comedian. He successfully trolled my entire audience at one point. Such sad news to hear about his passing. My condolences to his family and close ones," wrote the YouTuber in a now-deleted Tweet.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>As<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Daily Mirror</a> notes, it was this tweet that brought to light the real reasons behind Dillon's sudden disappearance.</p><p>While many fans took the tweet to be a mere hoax, it was revealed soon afterward that Dillon's family made the conscious decision to keep the YouTuber's tragic death a secret.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of making a public announcement, the family chose to maintain their privacy and grieve alone. For this reason, Dillon's fans only found out about the horrid event much later.&nbsp;</p><p>It is believed that Dillon passed away on July 28, 2019 at the age of 20. The family refused to publish further details.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was hard to keep this in for so long. RIP Dillon… my only friend in this dark world. Drink a Mountain Dew in Heaven with Jesus for me buddy," tweeted Dillon's best friend, BG Kumpi (Kevin Stafford) in response to the horrifying news.&nbsp;</p><p>"Many of you may be familiar with the name 'Dillon the Hacker.' He is someone who has provided us with such amazing satirical content. It’s why it is with great sadness for me to say that a month ago he passed away. He is someone who, on a personal level, I have shared some great moments with. Although our time together was not long, he was genuinely such a kind and funny person. He will be missed," wrote Dillon's friend, Selma.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSdoZyhvK9506GcZqCRmLimvg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-there-be-a-kingsman-3.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'The King's Man' Prequel Film Will Set up the Future for the 'Kingsman' Franchise</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./afcon-2021-super-eagles-captain-ahmed-musa-loses-family-member-leaves-camp.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Super Eagles Captain, Ahmed Musa Loses Family Member, Leaves Camp</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
