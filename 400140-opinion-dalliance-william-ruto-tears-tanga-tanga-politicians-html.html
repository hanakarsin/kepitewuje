Indeed, there is no common ideology most of those in Tanga Tanga share that can lay a foundation for offering an alternative to the current political dispensation in the country.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/650a62132981578d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Opinion: Voters’ wrath awaits William Ruto, Tanga Tanga MPs at the ballot next year</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/bc3a11cc2b16a931.jpeg><p class=align-left>That is why they are now disappointed that Muthama and others in UDA stole the show from them when they unveiled the wheelbarrow, the signature symbol of the Hustlers, as their party symbol.</p><p class=align-left>Left alone, none of these Tanga Tanga MPs can politically survive as they are all underwhelming when ranged against formidable forces backing the Uhuru Kenyatta/Raila Odinga Handshake in their backyards.</p><p class=align-left>Notably, Kuria, Jumwa and Kiunjuri are only clinging onto Ruto’s coat pockets after making costly political miscalculations. Jumwa and a section of pro-Ruto MPs, as well as former Mombasa senator Hassan Omar - who is desperate to get out of the political cold - are seeking to build a strong Coast-based party.</p><p class=align-left>Even Muthama himself is fighting hard to remain relevant having lost the grip he had on Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka.</p><p class=align-left>He only shifted to Ruto’s camp after realizing Kalonzo was determined to chart his own destiny by rallying behind the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/650a62132981578d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Joho, Kingi hint at ditching ODM for a Coastal political party ahead of 2022 elections</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He does not want to spend another five years in the cold having stayed out of the 2017 contest in the hope of landing a plum job in a NASA government. But it will not be easy. Already, his attempts to handpick a UDA candidate for the Machakos senatorial by-election is threatening to split pro-Ruto MPs in Ukambani.</p><p class=align-left>This and the failed attempt to trick independent candidates in Matungu to withdraw in support of a handpicked candidate, which has left an egg on the face of former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale, another desperate fellow, should send alarm bells ringing for those hoping to ride on a Ruto wave in 2022.</p><p class=align-left>It goes to show that the forces behind UDA are playing their cards close to their chests with Ruto’s apparent blessings, and they should brace themselves for boardroom nominations in 2022.</p><p class=align-left>No one will be assured of the party’s ticket and the sooner they realise this, the better.

The exercise was so chaotic that Kenyatta, as the party leader, had to step in and order repeat elections, though not all damage was undone.</p><p class=align-left>When it comes to Ruto, there is no civility.
