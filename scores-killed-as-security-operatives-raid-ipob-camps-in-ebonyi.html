Also, after dislodging the criminal elements and taking over the ground, the camp, which they christened ‘IGBO BU IGBO TRAINING SCHOOL CAMP’, was ransacked and destroyed. Equally, a wooden bridge under construction intended to aid the miscreants in their coming and going was dismantled.”</p><p>Items recovered from the gang according to Anyawu were 11 bullet-proof jackets, eight sets of Military camouflage uniforms, two camp-gas cookers, 110 rounds of FNC live ammunition, 40 rounds of GPMG live ammunition, and two PRO electronics scanners (EOD equipment).</p><p>Other items include five empty canons, five single-barrel guns, nine assorted GSM handsets, three locally-fabricated revolver pistols, one white Toyota Hilux vehicle, a bunch of keys, three NIN slips bearing different names, one exercise book with coded names/GSM numbers of the suspects, one voter’s card, three hammers, two assault rifle butts, 25 camping mosquito nets and charms, <strong>Naija News</strong> understands.</p><p>Anyawu further revealed that one Mercedes Benz 190 car with Reg No. SKA 306 AA, one Biafran-map calendar and other things, were also recovered from the raid.</p><p>He established that a good number of the criminals were neutralized, noting that the gang was also suspected to have taken part in the attack of the Provost of Federal College of Education, Isu Onicha along the Agba axis a few days ago.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FsZqybn6eytHnKoqOlnZRirrR50p6arqqZqcZuu8%2BeqZqsmauytHnRmqCdZZmlvKN5wpqkqatdnrtuscGopbKhXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./live-updates-sunday-igboho-appears-in-benin-republic-court.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sunday Igboho Appears In Benin Republic Court</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lvaro-mel-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>lvaro Mel - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
