Along with <a href=#>DMX</a>, <a href=#>Young Dolph</a>, <a href=#>Kangol Kid</a>, and Lil Loaded, Drakeo the Ruler was killed on Dec. 19 at a music festival in Los Angeles, Calif. The 28-year-old rapper, born Darrell Wayne Caldwell, was raised in South Central and rose to fame after being discovered by DJ Mustard.</p><p>Since his death, Drakeo’s fans and celebrity friends alike have taken to Twitter to share their condolences. But the rapper had a handful of enemies when he died — including a fellow West Coast rapper.</p><p>Now, fans wonder if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drakeo the Ruler’s ongoing beef with YG</a> was somehow related to his death. Here’s what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @drakeotheruler</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Drakeo the Ruler and YG have beef? The rapper’s death raises questions.</h2><p>Although both YG and Drakeo were raised in South Central, they found themselves embroiled in a bitter rivalry that reached its boiling point in March 2021. In a video that has since gone viral on social media, Drakeo threatens to kill YG for comments he made on Adam 22’s No Jumper podcast.</p><p>Drakeo claimed that his beef with YG was due to his disrespect. "A rap [n-word] going to get swiss cheesed he say one more thing, and they know that. I don't want no friends,” he said in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>.</p><p>Their online spat didn't seem to end there. Questions arose after West Coast rapper Slim 400 — who is closely affiliated with YG — was shot several times and killed in early December. His death came only weeks before Drakeo’s murder.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @drakeotheruler</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who killed Drakeo the Ruler?</h2><p>Drakeo died during a backstage brawl at Once Upon A Time in LA. The rapper was stabbed several times by an unknown assailant. Shortly after, the event was shut down and fans were asked to leave.</p><p>According to Los Angeles police, Drakeo’s murder is currently unsolved. As of now, no arrests have been made in connection with his murder.</p><p>Among the performers who also took the stage on Dec. 19 were YG and Ice Cube. Since then, a number of artists have come forward to pay homage to the rapper on social media.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by DRAKEO THE RULER (@drakeotheruler)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Snoop Dogg was among those to express his sadness. "My prayers go out to everyone affected by the tragedy. Please take care, love one another, and stay safe y'all."</p><p>Other friends of the rapper, like Drake, Saweetie, and Joey Fatts, also shared their frustration.</p><p>​​Joey wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, “Drakeo was killed while working. [He] was there for a performance. All these ‘get out the streets’ tweets [and] ‘leave your city’ tweets. Shut the f--k up.” He added, “No reason why a knife should be able to be snuck into a music festival. Especially since the Travis Scott s--t. RIP Drakeo.
