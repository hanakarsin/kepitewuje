The server stated that she was fresh out of training and ended up only working three hours during a day with low customer traffic, but still managed to pull in a decent amount of money for the time she spent there.</p><p>Commenters had a variety of different responses, but many seemed to agree that, even though it was a relatively slow night, something that a fellow server in Jools' clip corroborates on camera, she managed to earn a decent amount of money in that time period.</p><p>Jools begins the clip by saying: "OK so I'm fresh out of training at Texas Roadhouse. I have a two-table section, so follow me along tonight and let's see how much money I make." The video then cuts to her on the restaurant floor where she speaks into the camera.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@joolieannie href=#>@joolieannie</a><p><a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - ðŸ’•Jools ðŸ’•" href=#>â™¬ original sound - ðŸ’•Jools ðŸ’•</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @joolieannie</span></figure><p>"I didn't record this part but my first table left me a $10 on 67 which, ehh. They were really nice though, so..." That comes out to about 14 percent.</p><p>The camera then transitions to another table that left her a $4.65 tip on a $23.24 order (which is 20 percent). "It's also just...kinda slow today," she says.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @joolieannie</span></figure><p>"Ooh, she sweaty," she says, introducing her next take from another group she just served. "OK, my next table...$53.66, $13.41 tip... mmm, not bad." (That's 24 percent.)</p><p>At this point in the video another server at the restaurant comes on camera. "It's so slow, it's so slow," the TikToker's co-worker says.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @joolieannie</span></figure><p>Then she updates her followers on another table she served, "OK my next table's bill was like $43 and they gave me $15 and she said I was fab." That tip is almost 35 percent, so they must have meant it!</p><p>She then cuts to the last table she served, as she speaks into the camera.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @joolieannie</span></figure><p>"My last table's tab was $47 and they left me $12 [25.5 percent], so after everything was said and done I ended up making $61 in like 3 hours. It was a super short shift. But with my hourly that's twenty five dollars an hour," she then puts up a double peace sign and poses for the camera.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @joolieannie</span></figure><p>Judging from her reaction at the end of the video and her intake on a slow day, if that same pace of customers came in and out of the restaurant, on a slow day she could expect to make around $200 for a full eight hour shift.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @joolieannie</span></figure><p>Other TikTokers who said that they also work as servers stated that her take-home on a "slow" shift was actually pretty good. Others said that weekends, while more hectic, almost always provide an opportunity for higher hourly payouts.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @joolieannie</span></figure><p>Others said they couldn't believe she had a "slow night" at Texas Roadhouse to begin with, as they've visited the restaurant several times and it's almost always packed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @joolieannie</span></figure><p>There were some employees who said that while her payout was good, getting a schedule packed with enough hours to earn a livable wage is unfortunately very difficult. And then there were those who couldn't believe she only had a two-table section and said that getting large groups is where the real money's at.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLKzwsSrZKygn6zAbrTOsGSmrZOderS0xGakmqOVqHqwuoyaZKykn6x6r7XGoas%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./siya-kakkar-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Siya Kakkar's Death Has Shocked Her Huge Online Following Details</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ines-longevial-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Ines Longevial - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
