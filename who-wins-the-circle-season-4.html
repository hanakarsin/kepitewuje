Who is the Season 4 winner?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Frank from 'The Circle' Season 4.</p></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert: The following article contains spoilers for Season 4 of </strong><a href=#><strong>The Circle</strong></a><strong> on </strong><a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Social media strategy is the name of the game on the Netflix reality series The Circle. None of the contestants meet each other face-to-face, meaning that they can choose to compete as themselves, or as a catfish persona.</p><p>Every contestant ranks their fellow competitors each week, so the most popular players overall are more likely to win the $150,000 prize.</p><p>However, to quote another popular reality series, "One day you're in, and the next day, you're out!" Popularity can be fleeting. So, which contestant manages to charm their way to The Circle's huge cash prize? After the finale dropped on Netflix, here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>One of these contestants is no longer in the running on 'The Circle'.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The winner of 'The Circle' Season 4 is....?</h2><p>In the end, Frank takes home the win. He remains a top contender for most of the season thanks to his multiple stints as an influencer. And no one really puts him on their radar as they seek out other targets. By the end of the season, it's clear that Frank is on the fast track to winning. And in the May 25, 2022 Season 4 finale of The Circle, he does just that.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who were the true top contenders of the season?</h2><p>Frank emerged as a strong frontrunner from the start of Episode 1. His confident, vivacious personality was authentic as could be, and he's stayed true to himself so far in Season 4. He was voted as the first top influencer, which meant that his fellow contestants had ranked him the highest.</p><p>However, Alyssa also proved to be a worthy opponent. Not only did Emma Bunton and Mel B choose to visit her after they left the show, but she was voted as the second top influencer in Episode 6.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Yu Ling also captured our hearts from the get-go, with a personality that was even more vibrant than her bright, neon-highlighted hair. She was ranked as the top influencer in Episode 6, beating out Alyssa and Frank (who came in third in the Episode 6 ranking).</p><p>Surprisingly, Yu Ling and Alyssa both caught Mama Carol (<a href=#>John Franklin</a>) in a lie. They both came to the conclusion that she was a catfish, but decided that Mama Carol was still a valuable ally.</p><p>Even Season 4's two newcomer contestants, <a href=#>Trevor</a> (the husband of The Circle Season 2 winner <a href=#>DeLeesa</a>) and Eversen, voted to keep Frank safe from blocking in Episode 8, even though the pair hadn't had much time to interact with their fellow contestants.</p><p>Frank entered The Circle exuding confidence and charisma, and we would have frankly been shocked if he didn't end up winning the whole thing.</p><p>He proved that you don;t need to be a catfish or play tricks to win the game and future Circle contestants will be hard-pressed to play a stronger game than he did.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwedaipaxlpJ2ybq%2FIq5qlnV2osqK%2FzqdkbQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./just-in-president-buhari-nephew-dies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Just In: President Buhari Nephew Dies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fintiri-reveals-the-president-that-can-end-boko-haram-insurgency-in-nigeria.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fintiri Reveals The President That Can End Boko Haram Insurgency In Nigeria</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
