Deonn credits Lanise for helping him rise above his financial situation and building his confidence — the problem is they’ve never met. But is his online lover really who she says she is? Here's what we know about <a href=#>Deonn and Lanise</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Meet 'Catfish' hopeful Deonn and his online lover Lanise.</h2><p>According to Deonn, his relationship with Lanise started in the DMs. After the two began chatting, their relationship quickly evolved. Since then, Deonn and Lanise have built a bond that he says cannot be broken.&nbsp;</p><p>“You can't put a price on what she did for me. It makes you feel like, maybe God sent [her] to be in my life to help me out,” Deonn <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explains</a>. “When Lanise came around, she did something that nobody could do for 24 years of my life.”</p><p>Although Deonn believes that Lanise could be the love of his life and even has plans to propose, Nev and Kamie are still skeptical. Not only has he never seen Lanise on camera, but she has every excuse to avoid meeting him in person. Deonn also mentions that he has some bad relationship karma, which Kamie and Nev believe may be coming back to bite him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @mtvcatfish</a></p><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><p>Kamie tells Deonn, “You're saying you have all this drama with these other women. Now, here you are, two years into talking to the Lanise. She's being a little shady. She won't meet up. She won't video chat. I'm surprised that you're still pursuing her and letting her in and around your life.”</p><p>Despite their warnings, Deonn is committed to finding Lanise. Luckily, Kamie and Nev are the perfect people to help him do it. After hopping off of their call, Kamie immediately insists that an ex is the culprit behind Deonn’s online crush, and we’re inclined to agree.</p><p>“Deonn has been, admittedly, a bit of a player, right? It seems like as much as he wants to stay away from the drama, at this point in his life, he seems to kind of attract it,” Kamie says, adding, “I'm just worried that Deonn is about to get a taste of his own medicine.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, who is Lanise on ‘Catfish’?</h2><p>In the end, Kamie’s suspicions turn out to be true — kind of. Deonn ultimately learns that Lanise is actually his current girlfriend, Shanice. Yes, you read that correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>After some serious internet sleuthing, Kamie and Nev discover that Deonn is not being totally honest about his current romantic situation. His girlfriend, Shanice, suspected him of stepping outside of their relationship and took it upon herself to create an online alter-ego.</p><p>Deonn was visibly upset at Shanice for tricking him, and the couple broke up shortly after filming. Since then, Deonn and Shanice have gotten back together and claim their relationship is stronger than ever.</p><p>You can catch new episodes of Catfish Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbKwus1mmKecXaGur7XSnmScmaSbtrS0</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./we-tried-burger-king-royal-crispy-wraps.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>We Tried That: Burger King Royal Crispy Wraps Are an Alternative to Those Elusive Snack Wraps</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lexee-smith-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lexee Smith - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
