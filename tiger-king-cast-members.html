Which is your favorite big cat person?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>There are so many twists and turns in Netflix's docu-series <a href=#>Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness</a> that it can be hard to keep up with the storyline, let alone the hodgepodge of characters that viewers are introduced to.&nbsp;</p><p>Are you still confused about how exactly <a href=#>Mario Tabraue</a> is connected to <a href=#>Joe Exotic</a>? Or are you struggling to keep track of all of Doc Antle's wives? Don't worry, we have a complete breakdown of all the Tiger King cast members from Joe Exotic himself to his campaign manager Joshua Dial.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joe Exotic</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><p>The man, the myth, the legend. Joe Exotic is the subject of Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness on Netflix — and the central point in a tangled web of characters that include animal activist Carole Baskin, her missing husband Don Lewis, and his band of misfits at the GW Zoo in Oklahoma.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rick Kirkham</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Probably the sanest of Joe's motley crew, Rick worked as a producer for Joe Exotic TV. Before that, he was a reporter for Inside Edition and other reputable outlets.&nbsp;</p><p>He has since expressed regret for working for Joe and currently lives in Norway.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kelci "Saff" Saffery</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Despite having <a href=#>his arm savagely torn off by a tiger</a> on Joe's property, Saff —&nbsp;who is trans and uses he/him pronouns — &nbsp;worked at GW Zoo as an animal keeper and was back on the job just five days after the amputation.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Carole Baskin</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>The founder of Big Cat Rescue — and Joe's mortal enemy — Carole's life was examined closely in Tiger King, from her marriage to her second husband, Don Lewis, his unsolved disappearance, and Joe's attempt on her life.&nbsp;</p><p>Her husband, Howard Baskin, and daughter, Jamie Murdock (from her first marriage) were also featured on the show.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">John Finlay</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>John met Joe at the age of 19 and was married to him for 11 years. Along the course of their marriage, they added a third spouse — Travis Maldonado — and John got some serious ink to profess his love for his husband, including a tattoo that reads "Privately Owned by Joe Exotic" below his belly button.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he subsequently left Joe for his co-worker Amber, and the couple welcomed a child together in 2014.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dr. Bhagavan "Doc" Antle</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>His title might be the director of Myrtle Beach Safari, but Doc is more like a prophet leading his followers in a 50-acre sanctuary in South Carolina. And it's his collection of big cats (and women) that has Joe Exotic and others impressed.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">John Reinke</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Simply put, John is the manager of the GW Zoo, and one of Joe's right-hand guys.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Erik Cowie</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Erik found the job opening for Joe's zoo on Craigslist and quickly became the head keeper.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mario Tabraue</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>The self-proclaimed Scarface of the big cat world, Mario served 12 years in prison for his drug-smuggling enterprise in South Florida, which used exotic animals to transport contraband, before turning to exotic pets.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Barbara "Bala" Fisher</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>One of Doc's former apprentices, Barbara, who previously went as Bala, detailed her experience working for the "Lord" — she was gifted breast implants during her time on Doc's property – but she is adamant she never slept with the tiger keeper.&nbsp;</p><p>She left Doc's "cult" in 2007.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Travis Maldonado</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Joe's second husband, Travis, was also 19 years old when he met the eccentric zookeeper — and married Joe and his first husband John.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, Travis died tragically after accidentally shooting himself in the head on the property. He also struggled with drug addiction during his time with Joe.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Doc Antle's Wives</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Just as notorious as his cats, Doc's wives are also the talk of the town — and they include beauties Moshka, China, and Rajnee. The ladies each have their own home on Doc's compound and work with the tigers from 7 a.m. to midnight every day.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Don Lewis</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Carole Baskin's second husband Don Lewis went missing just as he was reportedly preparing to divorce Carole and move his big cat operation to Costa Rica.&nbsp;</p><p>His body has never been found, and Joe (and many others) believe Carole fed her husband to the tigers to cover up her crime. However, there is no evidence to suggest foul play.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ann McQueen</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Don's biggest supporter was Ann, his executive assistant, and she hopes to one day get some closure when it comes to his mysterious disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>Ann was also the only one who received a copy of the restraining order Don took out against Carole shortly before he went missing.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Marc Thompson</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>It's no surprise Joe needed security — especially from the bevy of animal rights activists who were determined to shut down his operation. His main guy was Marc.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Shirley and Francis Schreibvogel</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Joe's parents Francis and Shirley were dragged into the middle of his drama with Carole after she sued Joe's mom for illegally transferring funds. It also didn't help that Shirley's name was on all the bills associated with GW Zoo.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jeff Lowe</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Jeff introduced himself to Joe as an "investor" and promised to save the GW Zoo. Jeff went on to earn the nickname "The Godfather" but his relationship with Joe eventually soured and Jeff helped put Joe behind bars for the attempted murder of Carole.&nbsp;</p><p>He is best known for sneaking tiger cubs into Vegas hotels to make some money.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tim Stark</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Tim, of Wildlife in Need, became Jeff Lowe's partner when he took over the GW Zoo and moved it to a bigger location. Tim brought his own collection of exotic animals to the zoo, however, he was recently accused of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> violating the Animal Welfare Act.&nbsp;</a> He has also turned against Jeff.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dillon Passage</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Just two months after Travis' death, Joe tied the knot for the third time with Dillon, who became his accomplice.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joshua Dial</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Joshua was Joe's campaign manager and an eyewitness to Travis' tragic death.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Allen Glover</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Originally Joe's handyman, he became the first hitman Joe tried to pay to kill Carole, giving him $3,000 and a cellphone with her photo.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, Allen did not complete the task — and instead returned home to South Carolina.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">James Garretson</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NETFLIX</span></figure><p>The man most responsible for Joe's eventual arrest is James, who turned against Joe and became an informant for the FBI. It was James who introduced Joe to the second hitman (an undercover agent) and got him arrested for his murder-for-hire-plot.&nbsp;</p><p>Watch Tiger King on Netflix now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbaosdFmoqKml2Kwor%2FTZqSepZKav7Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./raising-hope-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Raising Hope - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ill-win-by-the-grace-of-god-oyetola-predicts-victory-as-he-opens-up-lead-in-osun-apc-guber-primary-election.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ill Win By The Grace Of God&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
