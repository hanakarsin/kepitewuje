Alerting folks that an image was screen-captured further solidified that notion and now, several years since its release, it's still one of the most widely used messaging platforms in the world with a slew of added features, like <a href=#>horoscopes</a>. But how do you get them on the app?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How do you get horoscopes on Snapchat?</h2><p>If you've got the application, then it's pretty simple. Here's what you have to do:</p><ul><li>Click on your Bitmoji icon in the app's upper left hand corner.</li><li>You're now in your profile; once you're there, click on the star sign underneath your username.</li><li>Once you do that, a prompt asking if you want to opt-in to the astrology portion will pop up on the screen.</li><li>You'll be asked to put in your birth date and area of birth.</li></ul><p>After you do that, then your star chart will begin to appear before your very eyes, unlocking all the cosmic mysteries of the universe that pertain to your fate, which was decided the moment you were born because each individual human being is super important and not some coincidence spurred on by our mammalian need to procreate.</p><p>It goes beyond those little blurbs you find in a 250-cent booklet at the checkout counter in the supermarket, too.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Snapchat has a new horoscope update and....

It includes what your presiding "Elements" are, along with "Polarity" and "Modality." You get a grand total of 13 slides that delve deep into your astrological persona, which includes some interplanetary garble.</p><p>Like most horoscopes, everything is worded fairly vaguely and positively ambiguous so you feel like whatever's put on the page can directly apply to you.</p><p>Whatever your thoughts on astrological signs are, you have to give credit to whoever developed this aspect of the app. It looks really cool and the level of granularity that's afforded to users is super impressive.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're still having trouble accessing it, here's how you do it, with pictures:</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">First, click on your profile.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Mustafa Gatollari</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Then you'll be greeted with this nifty little screen.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Mustafa Gatollari</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Once you input your personal details, you'll be greeted with this.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Mustafa Gatollari</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">They have a personal analysis for each planet.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Mustafa Gatollari</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's what your profile breakdown page will look like.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Mustafa Gatollari</span></figure><p>While a lot of the personality traits listed on my profile are way off, there are tons of people who swear that theirs got their individual characteristics nailed down pat.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>my horoscope on snapchat really just described my whole personality lmao</p>‚Äî alphajoy (@aznprrsuazion) <a href=#>November 12, 2020</a></figure><p>Other people found out that their parents didn't know as much about them as they had hoped.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>just wanted to set up my snapchat horoscopes üòîüòîüòî <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TzysCMFznd</a></p>‚Äî anya ‡•ê (@s2x_a) <a href=#>November 12, 2020</a></figure><p>Others are just in awe at how detailed the application gets.
