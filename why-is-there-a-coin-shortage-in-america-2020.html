Why is there a coin shortage in America 2020? Here's the lowdown on this strange occurance.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why is there a coin shortage in America 2020?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>, the latest random thing impacted by COVID-19 is coins in America. The news outlet says the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States of America, there is a real issue with not having enough circulating coins to support the economy.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The U.S is experiencing a coin shortage ??</p>— Gonzo (@gonzo_166) <a href=#>June 23, 2020</a></figure><p>"With the partial closure of the economy, the flow of funds through the economy has stopped," Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during a virtual hearing with the House Financial Services Committee, according to USA Today.&nbsp;</p><p>"We are working with the Mint and the Reserve Banks, and as the economy re-opens, we are starting to see money move around again."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>QuikTrip seeking change amid nationwide coin shortage <a href=#>https://t.co/3hlGAGKnfR</a> <a href=#>#kwch12</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/e7aAMTzFIJ</a></p>— KWCH Eyewitness News (@KWCH12) <a href=#>June 23, 2020</a></figure><p>Yes, the whole coin shortage issue is all related to the novel coronavirus, a side effect of shutting down or slowing down the economy that none of us regular people even thought could happen. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The Reserve Banks and Federal Reserve had to allocate the circulating coins, temporarily.</h2><p>According to a statement released by the Reserve Banks and Federal Reserve, on June 15, they had to be selective about where they sent the remaining coins to. &nbsp;</p><p>"The COVID‐19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the supply chain and normal circulation patterns for U.S. coin," the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> said. "In the past few months, coin deposits from depository institutions to the Federal Reserve have declined significantly, and the U.S. Mint's production of the coin also decreased due to measures put in place to protect its employees."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How did COVID-19 impact the coin shortage?</h2><p>We know that with the pandemic and the shutdown, people weren't spending as much money. But those that were buying things were recommended not to use coins out of fear that doing so could increase the spreading of the virus. Also, the U.S. Mint produced fewer coins than usual to help protect its employees from infection.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Since a bunch of businesses have been closed and the ones that are open have tried to go cashless there’s a coin shortage LMFAOOO</p>— ♡ (@yaytonna) <a href=#>June 23, 2020</a></figure><p>On top of this, those coin lobbies where people would go and deposit all their coins in exchange for bills were closed off, too, also impacting the coin distribution and circulation.&nbsp;</p><p>"The flow of coins through the economy ... kind of stopped," Powell said.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What are businesses supposed to do about the coin shortage?</h2><p>This issue is genuine for businesses that are now just getting back up and running. While there is still the option for contactless payment —using electronic banking, credit cards, and debit cards — there always should be the ability to use coins. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>So, what should a business do if they don't have enough coins to give exact change back?</p><p>Rep. John Rose, R-Tenn., told the House Financial Services Committee, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>, that if businesses are unable to make exact change, they will need to round up or down, during a "time when pennies are the difference between profitability and loss," he warned. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The best way to prevent contracting or spreading the coronavirus is with thorough hand washing and social distancing.
