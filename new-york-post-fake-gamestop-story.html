There's no other way around it, and this leaves <a href=#>many journalists</a> with a stark choice: do you spend a little bit of extra time on a story and do your due diligence? Or do you gun for a headline that's going to attract eyes and throw caution to the wind?</p><p>There are ways to kind of have your cake and eat it too if you're unsure about a source or are waiting on an answer: just say so in the story and update date it with the actual facts later.</p><p>But to present something as fact to the best of your knowledge without working to the best of your knowledge is, well, just dishonest and lazy; some would call it the "death of journalism."</p><p>And people are saying that it's this very phenomenon Twitter user @JackoWest_3 exposed after publishing a faux-tweet pertaining to the Gamestop/Robinhood controversy.</p><p>If you aren't familiar with what's going on here's a brief rundown: Reddit's r/WallStreetBets decided to all band together to mess with hedge funds that were short-selling businesses that have been on a downward spiral.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>a timeline of events <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZZbDquvLcM</a></p>— Jack (@JackoWest_3) <a href=#>January 28, 2021</a></figure><p>Some retailers like Gamestop, Nokia, and Blackberry were on the skids for several years, but there are other companies, like AMC Theaters, that have been adversely affected by the pandemic. "Scavenger" short-sellers at hedge funds placed bets that these businesses would fail and they were set to turn a profit on said failures. Often times hedge funds can "manipulate" the market by aggressively short-selling or make mass purchases on stocks to over-inflate their value.</p><p>So WallStreetBets asked themselves: why can't we do the same thing? If major financial institutions are able to manipulate the market and then take US tax dollars once their plans blow up in their faces for a bailout, why can't the American people make the same moves? So WallStreetBets started mass purchases of these "defunct" businesses. Gamestop's stock value skyrocketed even though retail locations have steadily been shutting down.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>amazing levels of journalism on the timeline today <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/w3ZpLsEvMT</a></p>— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) <a href=#>January 29, 2021</a></figure><p>The Redditors and everyone else who joined this effort invariably earned themselves a ton of money in the process and cost short-sellers billions.</p><p>The narrative that many news outlets who are said to receive funding from these financial institutions have taken massive losses is that these "rogue" Robinhood investors were committing illegal activity. Many are calling for the regulation of e-trading applications to prevent this same thing from happening again.</p><p>The real problem, that many are pointing out is that the massive transfer of wealth occurred the same way uber-rich institutions have been "gaming" the system for the longest time, they just got out-gamed by a bunch of "internet dweebs."</p><p>This, in a very long-winded way brings us to Jack, who decided to contribute to this narrative of "unruly kids" who just want to see the world burn.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>?

He decided to lie and say yes, he did actually take out the loan.</p><p>He didn't, and there really is no way he could.</p><p>Anyone who's purchased a home or even looked at the process of securing financing for one knows it's a long-winded, frustrating crucible of patience. And it's not like someone's child would be able to just up and get a second mortgage without the knowledge of their folks. There's a multitude of background and credit checks that are performed, which means he would've needed to commit major fraud to do so.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I mean to cover real estate you don't need to know how like deeds and ownership works, right?</p>— KAREN™ (@karen_killjoy) <a href=#>January 29, 2021</a></figure><p>However, the outlets that decided to report on the story didn't seem to ask Jack those questions and immediately decided to just go and post the story as fact.</p><p>Jack openly mocked two major news outlets that picked his "story" up The New York Post and Fox News.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait what?
