After Cancer Treatment and Everyone Is Psyched</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Robin Zlotnick</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated March 8 2021, 10:41 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It was mere months ago that <a href=#>Alex Trebe</a>k announced that he was battling stage four pancreatic cancer. Ever the stoic and slightly sassy professional, Trebek told us at the time that he planned to fight this cancer with everything he has, and that he had to because "under the terms of my contract, I have to host <a href=#>Jeopardy! </a>for three more years!"</p><p>So, when Alex Trebek started trending on Twitter the other day, fans' hearts were in their throats. This news could have been anything. Luckily, it was good news. Very good news.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When you see Alex Trebek trending, then find out he's alive and well. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/IPUjJKccg9</a></p>— Joshua Hardin (@Joshumz) <a href=#>August 29, 2019</a></figure><p>In an announcement video on the Jeopardy! Twitter account, Alex Trebek, looking just like his old self, announced that he has finished chemotherapy and he will be back to host the new season of the show. "I've gone through a lot of chemotherapy and thankfully that is now over. I'm on the mend and that's all I can hope for right now," he says in the video.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> confirmed with a Jeopardy! spokeswoman that the show's 36th season started filming on July 22 with Trebek at the helm, thank goodness. New episodes will start airing on September 9, so get your thinking caps on.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Alex is back in action! Join him on September 9 for the premiere of Season 36. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Vdv9t9vxDE</a></p>— Jeopardy! (@Jeopardy) <a href=#>August 29, 2019</a></figure><p>In the video, Trebek celebrates his 79th birthday on the Jeopardy! set and assures us "it's going to be a good year." Fans everywhere were just so thrilled that Alex Trebek is back in action. Jeopardy! simply wouldn't be Jeopardy! without him.&nbsp;</p><p>The warm-hearted jokes were in no short supply on Twitter and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>. One Redditor imitated Alex Trebek's signature snark when writing his imagined reaction to his own cancer: "**Looks at cancer and tilts head slightly** 'Sorry, no...'" "Better to be on Jeopardy! than in jeopardy," another Reddit user wrote.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Some argued that just because he's finished chemotherapy, that doesn't mean that he's beaten the cancer. Stage four pancreatic cancer is extremely aggressive and difficult to overcome, but it seems that Alex Trebek is on the mend.&nbsp;</p><p>In May, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Robin Roberts</a> on Good Morning America that he is "'doing well' despite not always feeling well." He told her, "My platelets, my blood counts are steady, my weight is steady ... the cancer indicators — those are coming down." And that was a couple months ago at this point. Hopefully, that means that the treatment has been working.</p><p>Fans are thrilled that he's strong enough to return to Jeopardy! "Happy he is going well enough to continue hosting," one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter user wrote</a>. "He is a man of steel!"&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>What can we say? The man is a legend of the deadpan disappointed comments. The way he makes fun of the contestants on the show is second to none. It's perfectly civil and devastatingly crushing all at once.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no one in the world who could do Alex Trebek's job, and we are so glad that no one else will attempt it while he's still around. He's been hosting the show since 1984 — for nearly 35 years. We stood by him through champion contestants and mustache shavings, and we'll continue to stand by him while he fights this cancer with everything he's got.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmmxIytqZ6alaB6o63CpGSjnZ%2BlrrOw2A%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hila-klein-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hila Klein - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1396421-50-fascinating-aztec-names-children-meanings-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>120+ fascinating Aztec names for children and their meanings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
