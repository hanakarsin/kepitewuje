We have today declared Baga as part of our territory and one of our operational base”.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Jonathan And Buhari Are Infidels - Boko Haram</a></p><p><i>“Jonathan you are in trouble. All governors of Nigeria are in trouble. All these war equipment that you see being displayed in the screen are gotten from Baga and Doro. Your army kept deceiving the world that you can’t fight us because you have no arms. Liars! You have all that it takes; you are just coward soldiers. You forgot that it is God that arms. Is it not amazing that we, who started with sticks and machetes, are today the biggest headache to the almighty Nigerian soldiers? What a shame!!</i></p><p><i>“Jonathan is it not shameful that now even your supporters are insulting and causing you? This should be a sermon to the world that you should not trust in humans. Any one that trusts a man will end up regretting. This is just the beginning of the killings; what you’ve just witnessed is a tip of the iceberg; more deaths are coming. This will mark the end of politics and democracy in Nigeria. This is to confirm to you that we carried out the Baga massacre, and we are going to do more.</i></p><p><i>“Nigerians are busy with politics, hailing Buhari! Buhari, Jonathan! Jonathan! Do you think the two of them are spared? Do you think even Buhari is a good Muslim? Buhari is not a Muslim as far as we are concerned – He is nothing but an infidel and our enemy.</i></p><p><i>“Muhammed Yusuf, the president of Niger, so you too have the temerity of coming out to pay sympathy visit to the Francois Holland the President of France. Is this your true character? Muhammed Yusuf, you have amazed us. You shall soon see our wrath, very soon.</i></p><p><i>“And you, Paul Biya, the president of Cameroon. Now you are asking for foreign assistance; please don’t waste your time because God is more than all the help you will get</i></p><p><i>“And even you Idris Debby, you are not spared. You guys have acted too late, very late.</i></p><p><i>“Before I end my speech; I want to react to a radio broadcast from France where the French said they are enemies of Islam and the prophet of Islam. I am going to read the France statement (he tried reading a French statement) In that broadcast the French government and people after insulting the holy prophet of Islam said a war against terrorisms is the same as fighting Muslims.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Boko Haram ‘Burn To The Ground’ 16 MORE Towns And Villages</a></p><p><i>“After this I will be setting ablaze the Nigerian flag just like we always do in all the places that we have conquered. It is a useless flag and its relevance would soon be a thing of the past. We are now showing the world all the arms and ammunition that we got from the Nigeria army barracks in Baga, Doron-Baga, Mile-4 and this barrack. What we have in our armoury now, plus all that we had before is enough to execute a victorious war against the whole Nigeria.</i></p><p>Shekau was later shown in the video setting a Nigerian flag on fire, and hoisting a Boko Haram flag. He then lifted a black flag with Arabic inscription as he recited an altered version of the first few lines of the Nigeria National Anthem, speaking in English:</p><p><i>“I pledge to Allah, my God, to be Faithful Loyal and Honest, to serve Allah with all my strength, to defend his Islam… Allahu Akbar!! Nigeria is dead; her constitution is dead!! Islam and Islam; war by war upon the Kafir who is the unbeliever”.</i></p><p><i>The concluding parts of the video showed a footage of some Boko Haram members setting flags of Nigeria on fire as one of them was heard saying; “and say the truth has come and falsehood has disappeared; verily falsehoods are bound to disappear”.</i></p><p>One of the Boko Haram members who was dressed in a kaftan with a belt on his waste and a turban around his head conducted the camera around a large a cache of arms and ammunitions, as he gave details on each weapon and how they were obtained.</p><p><i>“All these arms and ammunition you see in their thousands are gotten from Baga. We thank God for making this possible because he says we should always thank him for every good thing he does and he shall give us more. Words cannot express our gratitude to him. It is his mercy for us that is why we got them so easily. God says he would test us with all that he gives us; so we know God will be waiting to see what we would do with these things. Insha Allahu we are going to do his work with these arms at our disposal. We are going to sacrifice our lives in doing God’s work.</i></p><p><i>“As you can see we have thousands of AK 47 rifles, we have so much that we are still conveying them to our camp here. We have AA, we have different kind of them that can be mounted on vehicles. We have Shell Car; we have RPGs; we have mag and so on. We cannot just mention them. We have dozens of vehicles and thanks to God that has given us”.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Must Watch: Shekau Reveals Reason Behind BH Massacre In Baga</a></p><p>It will be recalled that <a href=#>January 3 and 7, 2015</a>, marked a very bad start to the year in Nigeria with the Boko Haram insurgency claiming the lives of more than 150 people in Baga, as reported by the military, while a recent satellite image released by Amnesty International&nbsp;reportedly shows that the Baga massacre claimed the lives of up to 2,000 people.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHeElWtvZq2gma61sYybpqSnXZ2us63MZp2upJxiw6qwxKhkraqRo8CtrdOipqdmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-this-is-where-we-stand-again-wike-gives-pdp-condition-to-support-atiku.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>2023: &amp;quot;This Is Where We Stand&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sparta365-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sparta356 - Edad, Familia, Biografa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
