But the film quickly became a cultural touchstone, beloved by audiences and critics alike. The catchphrase “Wakanda Forever” was everywhere and the stars of the movie were catapulted to international superstardom because of the film's massive success.</p><p>Sadly, the movie’s sequel, <a href=#>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a>, has faced a number of setbacks in production, including the unexpected and untimely <a href=#>passing of Chadwick Boseman</a>, who played King T'Chala, the titular Black Panther. Now, it’s been confirmed that Oscar-winning actor <a href=#>Daniel Kaluuya</a> will not be returning to reprise his role as W’Kabi.

Fans of Black Panther loved Daniel’s portrayal of W’Kabi, the Border Tribe’s head of security, who was also T’Challa’s best friend and confidant, and Okoye’s (Danai Gurira) husband.</p><p>But while Danai and other actors from the first movie are set to reprise their roles under Ryan Coogler’s direction, Daniel will not be joining them. According to the actor, his exit was due to scheduling conflicts with Nope, a new horror movie he stars in alongside Keke Palmer and Steven Yuen.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> reports that Daniel was asked to return but had already committed to star in Nope, which filmed at the same time as the Black Panther sequel. Daniel and Nope director Jordan Peele have collaborated before; Daniel starred in Jordan’s feature directorial debut, Get Out. Daniel’s stellar performance in the movie earned him an Oscar nomination and put the British actor on the Hollywood map.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span><p>Jordan Peele and Daniel Kaluuya</p></figure><p>Daniel has expressed how lucky he felt to be a part of the world of Black Panther. He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> in 2021 that the 2018 flick revolutionized superhero movies. “You’re bringing something into the world that doesn’t exist, and that’s just really difficult because there’s no blueprint, there’s no template. And there’s some pains in doing that. But when people receive it and people take it as their own, and kids and families are going dressed to the cinemas, it makes everything worth it,” he told the publication.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a>, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has had setbacks ever since it was announced. The sequel was first slated for release in May 2022, but those plans changed when Chadwick passed away in the summer of 2020, after a private battle with cancer. The studio decided to continue with the sequel anyway, but changed its creative direction in order to honor the memory of the late actor by choosing to “explore the world of Wakanda and all the rich and varied characters introduced in the first film.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney</span><p>Letitia Wright, Lypita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett and Martin Freeman in 'Black Panther'</p></figure><p>The movie began filming in June 2021 but had to take a break in the fall when acress Letitia Wright, who plays T'Chala's sister, tech genius Shuri, injured herself on set and needed time to recover. In January 2022, shooting was again interrupted by the COVID-19 Omicron surge.</p><p>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is now slated for release on Nov. 11, 2022. Meanwhile, fans of Daniel’s can watch him in Nope, which premieres July 22, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZJ2Znp6yrXnKmqOuramWeq%2B702agp2WSoa6kt4ypmKesmJq%2Fbn4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-you-use-xbox-one-controller-xbox-series-x.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>You Can Use Most of Your Xbox One Accessories With the Xbox Series X</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./did-terrel-williams-apologize.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Terrel Williams Doesn't Think He Did Anything Wrong to Prichard Coln</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
