However, the career route of being a <a href=#>celebrity</a> is one where you want your smile looking the best it can. Naturally, this means that many celebrities have had various sessions of dental work done on their less than perfect smiles.</p><h2>15 celebrities with bad teeth</h2><p class=align-left>Celebrities have bad teeth, just like any other person would have. Some celebrities would want to fix their bad teeth, but others embrace who they are. Here are 15 celebrities with messed-up teeth:</p><h3>1. Anthony Davis</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a908aa75b6723c01.jpg><p class=align-left>Anthony Davis is a world-class basketball <a href=#>player</a>, known by many because of his unibrow. His teeth, however, are misaligned and crooked, a situation that does not favour him, especially during light fun moments with friends.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/314b88bca0be5821.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 former Hollywood actors who went crazy in real life (and their whereabouts)</span></p></a><h3>2. Madonna</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/314b88bca0be5821.jpg><p class=align-left>Madonna is an American singer and songwriter, always referred to by many as the “Queen of pop”. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Madonna </a>has a gap between her two front teeth. Celebrities like Madonna care much about their public image, and her teeth are one of the aesthetic concerns. She seems to have done some dental activities to narrow the gap between her teeth.</p><h3>3. Zac Efron</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/820c7162b8076f8d.jpg><p class=align-left>Zac Efron is an American singer and actor who began his career in the early 2000s. Efron had a big gap between his teeth that would make him uncomfortable most of the time. He, therefore, visited a dentist to reduce the gap before having many career engagements.</p><h3>4. Anna Paquin</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/081e2670109ba409.jpg><p class=align-left>Celebrities worldwide tend to feel uncomfortable with their bad teeth, so many do dental work to repair them. But for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Anna Paquin</a>, the story is different as she has left the gap between her teeth to grow. When she was a child, the gap was small, and it has continued to grow.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/15a2b6225ac6e847.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Izzy on Flip or Flop?

However, his front teeth were larger than the rest of the teeth, which did not stop him from entertaining masses of people. But it was until another rapper, a friend of his, made fun of him, and he decided to correct the problem. He reduced the big teeth to align with the rest of the teeth, but the gap remains.</p><h3>6. Kirsten Dunst</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/15a2b6225ac6e847.jpeg><p class=align-left>Another <a href=#>celebrity</a> broke the norm of visiting a dentist to fix her teeth, as many celebrities occasionally do. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dunst</a> has crooked teeth, which many people would want her to fix. She grew up with pressure around her and felt she needed to correct the problem but thanks to Sofia Coppola, a film director who encouraged her not to correct her teeth.</p><h3>7. Ricky Gervais</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a26114cf10cc77c5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 most difficult actors to work with in Hollywood 2021</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dbe28b554d898378.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ricky Gervais</a> is the comedic mastermind behind the original TV series<i> The Office</i>, the British one that spawned similar shows in other countries. Gervais has a nasty mouthful of pearly once-were whites, and they all seem to be out of order.</p><h3>8. Steve Buscemi</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d0c03a2565ecb240.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Buscemi </a>has entered into the list of famous people with bad teeth. He has stood firm to reject those who advise him to fix his teeth. The film industry is quite challenging as it seems to favour those who have it all right. But with few celebrities like Buscemi, such a narrative has changed.</p><h3>9. Johnny Depp</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a26114cf10cc77c5.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Johnny Depp</a> is one of the celebrities with yellow teeth. People took a keen look at Depp's life, especially the teeth, in 2017 when he was involved in a divorce with actress Amber Heard. He has a red tinge on one tooth, and many people were surprised when they first realized dental work on his teeth.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/56b57511c8b74b1b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 meanest celebrities in real-life according to fans</span></p></a><h3>10. Vanessa Paradis</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ae76cee5e64bd21b.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Venessa</a> has embraced the gap between her teeth, and she is always proud to smile in public without shying away or closing the gap. In many interviews, she has been asked about her gap; she has consistently said the gap is helpful, and she can even spit water through it.</p><h3>11. Michael Strahan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b74711e2d2e96b6b.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Michael </a>is a former <a href=#>football</a> player, a journalist, and a<a href=#> television</a> personality known for his charming, gap-toothed smile. He felt a lot of pressure to close the gap when he was a professional footballer, but he decided to embrace the gap and accept who he is.</p><p class=align-left>Celebrities with messed-up teeth tend to deny themselves, not so with Strahan, who thinks his children cannot recognize him without the gap.</p><h3>12. Lindsay Lohan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f675eb3ae94f777.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lindsay</a> had discoloured teeth which she fixed and continues to maintain. She was one of the celebrities with the worst teeth in Hollywood, and it made her uncomfortable. Many of her fans did not like the discoloured teeth, and they attributed the problem to her alcohol and drug use lifestyle.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f6feabbb94bb397d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is the cutest person in the world?

She got porcelain veneers, which are not only brighter white, but also are larger and more symmetrical along their bottom ridges.</p><p class=align-left>Celebrities with bad teeth have a hard time coping up with their situation. But many are embracing their messed up teeth and are encouraging many not to fix but accept who they are. You can fail to put on a perfect smile, but you can afford a natural smile, not a fake one.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke </a>shared an article about <a href=# title>celebrity best friends</a> in real life and their story. It is not entirely true that there cannot be celebrities who are best of friends in real life. Some were friends before they became celebrities while others met as celebrities and could not resist the chemistry.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/73a3535430f43087.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top details about The Chi season 3: full cast members and characters list, episodes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Celebrities need friends with whom they can share their problems.
