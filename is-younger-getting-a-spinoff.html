At one point, it seemed that we would be saying more of a “see you later” to Kelsey because reports of a spinoff had surfaced in May 2020. A few months later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET Canada</a> reported that Darren Star, the show's creator, shared in a video interview with the Associated Press his idea about the spinoff.</p><p>He said, “I love Hilary Duff, and I think it’s gonna be something that [will] possibly be a whole different show than Younger but sort of it would be her character.”</p><p>In April, Darren was still considering the idea of a potential spinoff and told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, “We’re talking about it. It’s a big question mark whether it’s going to happen. It could be great, but we never know if these things are going to happen until they’re going to happen.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Parmount Plus</span></figure><p>Unfortunately, there isn't going to be a Younger spinoff, and we will be bidding Kasey a farewell too. The spinoff isn't happening, likely because <a href=#>Hilary is set to produce and star in another spinoff</a>.

We know that the spinoff was never officially a done deal, but we hoped it would pan out. Still, you can catch Hilary on a new series. She will play Sophie, the main character and narrator on the long-awaited How I Met Your Mother spinoff — How I Met Your Father. The show has received a straight-to-series order on the streaming platform Hulu.</p><p>As Sophie, Hilary will be telling her son the story of how she met his father. The story of the spinoff, according to the logline shared by Hulu, "catapults us back to the year 2021 where Sophie and her close-knit group of friends are in the midst of figuring out who they are, what they want out of life, and how to fall in love in the age of dating apps and limitless options."</p><p>Even though Younger isn't getting a spinoff now, that doesn't mean that it couldn't happen at some point.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Plus</span></figure><p>Nico Tortorella, who plays Liza's love interest Josh, feels that his character isn't done telling his story. In a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET</a>, he revealed, "Did I send an email to the powers that be about a Josh spinoff? Yeah, I did. I think there's more story to be told. There's a really compelling narrative there about a single father raising a daughter in 2021 and what that means living in New York City and owning tattoo shops. There's something there."</p><p>He went on to say, "I don't know about how realistic it is, but I'm just letting people know that I'm opening the conversation." We would totally watch a new series starring Josh! Only time will tell if Younger will ever get a spinoff, but maybe a movie could be on the horizon.</p><p>When asked about a revival of the show, Darren told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, "I don’t know about rebooting the entire series, but could we come back for a movie at some point, that would be a lot of fun, down the line, to think about."</p><p>You can check out the end of Kelsey, Liza, and the rest of the characters' stories in the finale of&nbsp;Younger, now streaming on Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuxc6upaCdomK0psDToqWgZZFiwLG1zaidnw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mildred-and-tiff-still-together-the-ultimatum-queer-love.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Are Mildred and Tiff Still Together?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1154853-the-biggest-market-africa-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The biggest market in Africa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
