I am sure those of them in my party before they cannot say anything without mentioning Wike. But now because I said let the right thing be done, I have now become an enemy. These are people who are praising me for everything.</p><p>“And some people believe they won’t obey an agreement but we say it must be done. We stand for equity, fairness and justice. That is what the G5 will continue to preach. We have said we are not against reconciliation but it must be based on equity, fairness, and justice”.</p><h2>A United Nigeria</h2><p>The Rivers Governor further emphasized the need to have a Nigeria that everyone can be proud of regardless of religion, ethnicity, or other factors.</p><p>He added that nobody should be a second-class citizen in his or her own country.</p><p>According to him, “What we require in this country today is united Nigeria. It is how all of us can see ourselves as one and how we can see ourselves as our brothers’ keepers.</p><p>“We need a Nigeria that all of us can be proud of, that I will know that truly I am not a second class citizen, that the same right you have is the same right I have, the same opportunity you have is the same opportunity that I have. No need of saying if you are not from this place people will not vote for you. We don’t want that.</p><p>“We want a Nigeria that everybody can say indeed this is the Nigeria we are looking for. For us, all we are looking for is how Nigeria will progress, and how people will have food on their tables. It is not about ethnicity, it is not about religion and it is not about party. It is about how Nigeria will progress. That is where we stand.”</p><h2>Rivers People Will Bargain</h2><p>Wike emphasized the people of Rivers State will only vote for those who will protect their interests, emphasizing that the days of free votes are over.</p><p>He said: “Like I said politics now is a matter of interest. You must tell me what the interest of Rivers State is. If my state will not benefit I will not join you. I will not join anybody, who doesn’t want my state to benefit. I will not support anybody who doesn’t support my state. For us, if you hate us, we hate you. If you like us we like you”.</p><h2>We Need Leaders With Integrity</h2><p>The Rivers State Governor went on to advocate for leaders and politicians with integrity saying those without integrity have nothing to offer Nigerians.</p><p>He said he is someone that does whatever he says and if for any reason he won’t be able to fulfill his promise, then he makes it known to those he promised.</p><p>“What is important about leadership is integrity. If you have lost your integrity, there is nothing you can offer again. That is the problem we have in this country.</p><p>“Politicians will stand up and make a statement and then people are watching you to fulfill that statement, and then when you don’t Nigerians will say that is how politicians behave. I don’t agree to that. Individuals can behave that way but I won’t behave that way.</p><p>“If I say something today, I will make sure I do it. If there is any reason why I won’t do it, I will come back to you and let you know the reason. If you want to lead the people, you must lead by example. People should stop thinking that blackmailing people will help anybody. It will rather damage your case more. Nobody can intimidate us and nobody can tell us what to do. Nobody can choose my friends for me,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BvZmtoYmh6tbTIrGSiq12staa%2BxGaunmWjqa6vsIyanpqhnmLEqrfEZp6irpWoerGwz2aaqKaUnsGqu81mq6hlo6q9sbvRrWSarJmgwnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./project-rose-meaning.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Britney Spears Explains She Wore the Same Top on Instagram 17 Times for &amp;quot;Project Rose&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./368628-update-boko-haram-full-video-translation-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>UPDATE: Boko Haram Full Video Translation</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
