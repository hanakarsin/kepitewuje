Is he about to permanently dock? What we know about Kyle Dickard.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC Universal</span></figure><p>Recently, the least-popular-crew-member award is definitely going to <a href=#>Below Deck Adventure</a>'s Kyle Dickard, whose last name is suddenly more of a descriptor than anything else. Kyle has been stirring things up for the rest of the crew on the Mercury and is causing emotional temperatures to rise. Between inappropriate flirting and fighting with his co-workers, he is no one's favorite at the moment. What's the deal with <a href=#>Kyle Dickard</a>? Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Kyle Dickard from 'Below Deck Adventure'?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bravo</a>, Kyle hails from <a href=#>Texas</a> and struck out at age 19 to see the world. It was in the Bahamas where Kyle discovered his passion for yachts. (Wow, what an unusual thing to fall in love with ‚Äî huge expensive boats. What could be the appeal?) Obviously buying his own yacht was not on the agenda, so Kyle began working as a deckhand.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@dr.dickard</a></figure><p>Kyle's personality can best be described as cocky and off-putting, but he hides both those things behind a sea of <a href=#>southern charm</a> and an aw-shucks attitude. On the show's premiere he described himself as a "hopeless romantic" and "lovable cowboy," though we have yet to see any evidence of either. As far as romance goes, Kyle is mostly interested in older women who can buy him things. We hope someone buys Kyle a long walk off a short pier. Beyond being insufferable, he's also making enemies on the Mercury.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kyle might already be getting fired from 'Below Deck Adventure.'</h2><p>In an exclusive look at Episode 3 given to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, we learn that Kyle might be walking the plank pretty soon. "Today Nathan [Morley] was really upset because Kyle started threatening him with violence,‚Äù <a href=#>Captain Kerry Titheradge</a> tells <a href=#>Lewis Lupton</a> in the sneak peek. "I feel that he is a threat to the safety of other crew members."</p><p>Whoa, that sounds more serious than some run-of-the-mill hijinks. Before this mysterious incident, Kyle's future was looking bright.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This kid, Kyle Dickard, from <a href=#>#belowdeckadventure</a> is just the epitome of ick. Stereotypical arrogant good ole boy. ü§Æ</p>‚Äî VeeTitus (@VeeTitus_) <a href=#>November 10, 2022</a></figure><p>"I'm a little bit upset by it; I was going to save him ‚Äî you know, he is the most experienced and I would have liked him to become lead deckhand," Lewis responds in the clip. "I mentioned it to him that if could behave more professionally ‚Äî it is his to lose."</p><p>It is at this point in the clip that Captain Titheradge floats the idea of firing Kyle.</p><p>"So when I bring this up with Kyle, he has the right to explain himself. But these actions are grounds for instant dismissal," explains the captain.</p><p>In a confessional, Lewis expresses his desire for Kyle to do better. "He is definitely not the picture of a perfect crew member," says Lewis. "But Kyle is experienced enough that I could learn some things from him." Lewis goes on to say, "But I need him on deck and I hope this conversation goes well with Kerry. I hope Kyle can turn this around."</p><p>To find out Kyle's fate on the Mercury, tune into Below Deck Adventure Tuesday, Nov. 15, at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoMatsYydoJyjkaexbq7EpaawZZSasKx5wJ2tnqakqr%2Bm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lebron-james-high-school-coach.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>LeBron James's High School Coach Keith Dambrot Wasn't Easy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./evan-todd-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Evan Todd - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
