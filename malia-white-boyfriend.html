For the first time on any Below Deck show, the captain, the chief stewardess, and the bosun are all women.</p><p>After working as a deckhand on Season 2 of the series, <a href=#>Malia White</a> has worked her way up, and she's the head of the deck team on The Wellington.&nbsp;</p><p>While boat romances aka boatmances are a main staple on the hit Bravo series, Malia explained on the June 1 premiere that she had been dating a man named Tom for more than a year. But, loyal viewers of the show will know that having an off-boat relationship doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be something going on in the crew mess.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Malia White have a boyfriend?</a> Read on to find out the update in her personal life, if she's still with her boyfriend Tom, and for the refresher on her first season of <a href=#>Below Deck Med</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Does Malia White have a boyfriend?</h2><p>When Malia first appeared on Below Deck Med in 2017, she was in a complicated love triangle with Chef Adam Glick and bosun Wesley "Wes" Walton (though deckhand Bobby Giancola also unsuccessfully threw his hat in the ring). Throughout the entire season, Malia went back and forth with her feelings, as she had secretly met Adam before filming began, but she also couldn't deny that she liked Wes too.&nbsp;</p><p>She chose and ultimately pursued a relationship with Wes off the boat, but the two parted ways several months after filming concluded. Things are far different for Malia on Season 5, as the bosun is in a committed relationship with Tom Checketts on the show.</p><p>During the premiere episode, she and bunkmate / chief stew Hannah Ferrier discussed being in long distance, long-term relationships while on the boat. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"You've got a boyfriend, right? Tom?" Hannah asked before the two turned out for the night.&nbsp;</p><p>"Yeah, British. Chef," Malia responded, before explaining that the two had been together for more than a year.&nbsp;</p><p>Tom and Malia certainly have a lot in common as Tom is a chef on a yacht. The two first met in October of 2018, and Malia hinted that they were working together when they first crossed paths. &nbsp;</p><p>Despite filming the intense Bravo series on location, Malia and Tom are still going strong. The bosun posted a photo with her beau in late May of 2020, and she indicated that the two were once again dating long distance.&nbsp;</p><p>"Missing weekends in Amsterdam with Tom Checketts," she captioned a snapshot of the two together in Amsterdam.</p><p>"I miss you too Gorg," Tom replied in the comments.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where is Wes Walton from 'Below Deck Med' now?</h2><p>It's clear that Malia has moved on from Wes since they embarked on a boatmance in front of the cameras, but what has the former bosun been up to?&nbsp;</p><p>Per his Instagram page, Wes spent some time working on a boat in the Arctic. He also is certified as a Chief Officer 3000.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Wes has not posted photos with a special someone since his breakup with Malia, but there's every chance that he's keeping his personal life more private these days.&nbsp;</p><p>Below Deck Mediterranean airs on Mondays at 9 p.m. on Bravo.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6ttcBmrqGhpJp6o7vYn6minZ6Z</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./october14-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>October 14 Horoscope and Zodiac</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-was-rod-blagojevich-pardoned.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Was Rod Blagojevich Pardoned?
