As if the hardship on the people is not enough; there are some people who would want to test the will of the government and the government is saying such actions are unacceptable.</p><p>“We’re all living witnesses when the government came up with a policy of banning the movement of building materials across the country’s border. We’re a border state and we’ve had issues where items are transported across the border,”&nbsp;SaharaReporters quoted Wonosikou saying.</p><p>He added: “But then the government, for building materials, would not want them transported out of the country. You can see behind me are trucks that were apprehended and brought here. They were intercepted by the military.</p><p>“And it is believed that these products are being transported out of the country, because if you look at it, where is the community at the border area in Adamawa State that requires this amount of cement to be used?”</p><p>On his part, Nguroje said, “Personnel have been deployed throughout the state to enforce the government order, banning transportation of building materials across the border.”</p><p>Nevertheless, the Yola depot officials of Dangote Cement, who were reportedly present at the scene, strongly refuted any claims of the products being transported to Cameroon.</p><p>One of them, who spoke reportedly addressed journalists on condition of anonymity for lack of authority, argued saying, “This is a clear violation of our right to do business! It is absolutely wrong for our trucks to be intercepted within the Nigerian territory.</p><p>“The goods in these trucks were procured by our customer, who requested them to be conveyed to Jamtari. It is, therefore, not in our right to demand an explanation as to why he wants them there.”</p><p>However, in a surprising turn of events, Abiola Oyetunji, who was listed as the contact person on the waybill, was taken aback to discover that the truck had already departed from the company’s depot in Yola.</p><p>She emphasized that the trucks are only allowed to leave the depot once the goods have been sold.</p><p>“I’ve not sold the cement yet; how could the truck have moved out of the depot in Yola? The driver told me he was at the depot up to this time,” she reportedly added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5BvZpuqlZa4qrrGZpirpalitq%2FAxKuanqikqHqlrc2gpq2dXam%2Ftq%2FKrGSapJyatKawy7JkraqRo8Cxu9GtoKefXaW%2FsLTIm6CtnZRitLC7w6xkraddmK6usdGopqdn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pontiacmadeddg-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>DDG - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-are-nintendo-xbox-and-sony-skipping-e3.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Are Nintendo, Xbox, And Sony Skipping E3 2023?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
