Without screenwriters, showrunners, and actors, most of your favorite media pieces would remain just an idea in someone's head.</p><p style=text-align:start>In 2023, the WGA and SAG-AFTRA struck over a labor dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The WGA reached <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a tentative agreement</a> on Sept. 27, which was then ratified on Oct. 9. SAG-AFTRA <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is still on strike</a>, meaning that union members <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cannot promote struck work</a>.</p><p style=text-align:start>Many production companies use fan conventions <a href=#>like New York Comic-Con</a> to promote their work, but what happens when they can't? Here's the scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's how the entertainment industry strikes affected Comic-Con.</h2><p style=text-align:start>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a>, while on strike, members of SAG-AFTRA cannot "provide publicity services" at places such as "tours, personal appearances, interviews, conventions (including Comic-Con), fan expos, festivals, panels, for-your-consideration events, panels, premieres and screenings, award shows, junkets, podcast appearances, social media and studio showcases."</p><p style=text-align:start>The article notes that SAG-AFTRA members can talk about the entertainment industry in general but cannot promote specific work.</p><p>Prior to New York Comic-Con on Oct. 12, con organizer ReedPop's global comics portfolio Vice President, Kristina Rogers, spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> to talk about how the strikes affected programming at the event.</p><p>"I think the removal of some of these studio offerings allows for more bandwidth and more of that message to come through — all of this content is still happening. The content from our comic companies is really cool and interesting, and now that we don’t have the Main Stage pretty crammed full, fans are paying a little bit more attention, which I love to see."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p style=text-align:start>Actors and NYCC headliners Chris Evans, Ewan McGregor, and David Tennant spent time on the Empire Stage answering fan questions and talking about their lives. Chris even mentioned he'd like to perform on Broadway in the future, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>.</p><p style=text-align:start>Charlie Cox, whose show Daredevil: Born Again was halted due to the strike, even attended the convention as a fan, choosing to cosplay as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">children's cartoon character Bluey</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Many panels highlighted members of the production team at New York Comic-Con 2023.</h2><p>Rather than sending actors to promote work, panelists such as <a href=# style=text-align:start>Percy Jackson the Olympians</a> for Disney Plus, Argylle for Universal Pictures, and BlumFest for <a href=# style=text-align:start>Blumhouse Productions</a> sent directors, showrunners, screenwriters, costume designers, and other essential studio team members to talk about their work instead.</p><p>Often, these valuable team members do not get the chance to share more information about their work in a promotional capacity, so it was a treat for audience members to learn about what goes on behind the scenes from a unique perspective.</p><p>Not to mention, the National Association of Voice Actors (NAVA) and SAG gave permission for a panel of voice actors to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discuss a performers' perspective on the use of AI</a>, one of the many critical discussion points on which the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike is built.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Authors were also given a bigger spotlight at New York Comic-Con 2023.</h2><p style=text-align:start>Past comic conventions have included authors and tables from publishing houses, but in 2023 in particular, the "Big Five" publishing houses were present on the show floor. There was also a noticeable uptick in <a href=#>authors' inclusion</a>, especially spotlights on science fiction fantasy author powerhouses V.E. Schwab and <a href=#>Cassandra Clare</a>.</p><p style=text-align:start>Authors participated in panels revolving around particular genres, such as horror <a href=#>or romantasy</a>, and discussions <a href=#>about book bans</a> that have rapidly swept the nation.</p><p>It's encouraging to see conventions navigate the strikes in a way that doesn't break SAG-AFTRA rules while also supporting artist work. Even after the strike ends, including more members of the creative teams to speak about their craft would be an excellent choice moving forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edKtqaKjlah6orLFnpqtnZRisLC5yJxknKee</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./400704-jamaicas-leading-goal-scorer-passes-aged-35-long-illness-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jamaica's leading goal scorer passes away aged 35 after long illness</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-walz-horse-story-rumor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Tim Walz Horse Story Rumor Has Been Debunked</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
