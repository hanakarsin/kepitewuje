While crying, she claimed he always spends "every little timeframe" on it instead of doing something with her.</p><p>The situation led the boyfriend to Reddit under the username handle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">by-the-grip-of-Ntropy</a> to ask members of the AITA thread if he was wrong from his perspective.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Throughout the trip, OP spent days sunbathing and enjoyed a beautiful boat trip with his girlfriend but admitted beforehand that his gaming habits were driving a wedge in their relationship.</p><p>"I like to game, and I recharge myself while doing so, [but] she doesn't understand it at all," OP stated. "I fully understand that it is not simple to live with somebody who loves to gaze into a display all the time, which is why I heavily restrict it when we spend time together."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The boyfriend goes as far as giving his phone to her while out together to be fully present. Everything was fine until he popped open his notebook while she was showering to do "1-2 quests" in a video game one night. She got very upset.</p><p>The following morning, OP woke up around 6 a.m. to make coffee and start a game while his girlfriend slept, sneaking in some "me-time on the computer" to unwind. As mentioned, that backfired on him — his girlfriend was more upset and crying over what he was doing.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>OP stated playing video games during their holiday could make him out as a jerk, but he chooses times to enjoy his hobby during moments that wouldn't "matter what I do," referencing when his girlfriend sleeps or is busy.</p><p>Thousands of users on the thread came to his defense. One user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a> he did "absolutely nothing wrong" and compared his gaming to "watching TV or reading a book." They added, "When she's occupied, you're allowed to do whatever you want."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another stated</a>, "You both need to have a discussion on expectations," and believed the OP wasn't wrong.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"I game to recharge too," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said a Redditor</a> who agrees with OP and acknowledges that gaming during vacation can be unwise. "My partner is understanding, but they'd be much less understanding if I took it to a romantic vacation."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Later in the thread, OP <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clarified</a> he had a gaming addiction before meeting his girlfriend, alongside several bad habits like "smoking, junk food, clubbing, alcohol." He also mentioned his partner "cries a lot because of me or things I say or do ... I also think that she has a problem with not getting enough intimacy with me."</p><p>The entire predicament exposes a deep disconnect between the couple over what they want in the relationship. OP cares about finding time to play a game during downtime, but his partner seems starved for intimacy.</p><p>It's unclear what OP did afterward, but this could make or break their relationship if nothing changes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLazuMWroJ6mlGLCsb%2FErWSvoZSavG6zwKacrGWmlrCiwMiopQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nicole-meyer-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nicole Meyer - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-baby-billys-son-righteous-gemstones.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Baby Billy Has a Brand New Son in 'The Righteous Gemstones' What Happened to His First One?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
