However, if it's someone that shouldn't really matter to you in the grand scheme of things and they aren't affecting your job or ability to have meaningful relationships with those that you love, then it's probably best to just let them go on hating on you off in a corner somewhere.</p><p>However, if it's someone that you work with or for, then you'll probably want to know where they're coming from with all of that behind-the-back rage. This is probably why this TikToker's video went viral.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@samantharaegarc href=#>@samantharaegarc</a><p>I quit my job of 4 years today.

The TikTok user appeared to take the whole thing in stride, even whispering rejoinders in the video and turning the entire situation into a comedic piece of content.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @samantharaegarc</span></figure><p>The video's text overlay reads: "My boss didn't know I was right here while she was talking s*** about me," followed by a painting nails emoji. A caption attached to the now-viral TikTok reads: "I quit my job of 4 years today. I'm done with these disrespectful, hasn't had manager training in 50 years managers BYE."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @samantharaegarc</span></figure><p>Samantha also added a heart emoji and her CashApp information. (probably because, well, she just quit her job.)</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @samantharaegarc</span></figure><p>So what was the root of Samantha's manager's ire? She says in the comments that her (former) boss "was upset because I used a to-go container instead of a tin container for two of our entrees. She claimed she had told me to do this already."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @samantharaegarc</span></figure><p>In the video, Samantha's manager could be heard mocking her voice and saying that didn't want to "baby" people any longer.</p><p>There were tons of commenters who replied to the video who were impressed with Samantha's self-control. Others stated that it's because of bosses like the one that the TikToker had that folks are quitting jobs left and right.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @samantharaegarc</span></figure><p>Another commenter remarked that the TikToker could file for unemployment even though she quit, blaming her for doing so in a "toxic work environment.</p><p>It should also be noted that Samantha was working a gig in the foodservice industry, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">job market right now that is going through a heck</a> of a time trying to fully staff its locations.</p><p>There is a silver lining for Samantha, however. She states that she applied for a new "dream" job in the comments section, and she ultimately landed it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @samantharaegarc</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @samantharaegarc</span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbaswM6knKtlkqTAtHnSppico12prq23yKee</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./january3-actress-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Actresses Born January 3 | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./409623-safari-hii-sio-mbuzi-raila-odinga-afurahia-zawadi-ya-viatu-kutoka-kwa-vijana-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mara Hii Sio Mbuzi: Raila Odinga Afurahia Zawadi ya Viatu Kutoka kwa Vijana</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
