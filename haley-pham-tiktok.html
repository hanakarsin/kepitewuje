She said the video was satire and then uploaded it again in full.</p><p>Haley is no stranger to negative comments and it's not a big surprise that she's asking for less critiques in 2020. The 19-year-old had a rough 2019 and, if her latest video is any indication, 2020 might not be much better.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Haley Pham's recent TikTok controversy isn't her first one.</h2><p>In 2019, Haley travelled to Santorini. Sounds beautiful, right? Well, according to her, it was far from a nice trip. She took to YouTube to tell her followers that she highly discourages them from visiting Greece.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>acting natural in Greece ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡·</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Haley Pham</a> (@haleypham) on Sep 3, 2019 at 5:59am PDT</p></figure><p>"Not only are they economically struggling and the government is kind of struggling right now, but it's just, like, not fun," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>. "Santorini's not is pretty as the Instagram bloggers make it seem." The actual video has since been removed, but nothing is ever truly gone when it comes to the internet. Many other YouTubers critiqued her video and commented on why what she did and said in it has negative repercussions. Many called her "spoiled" and "privileged".</p><p>"The bigger you're getting, the more you have to be cautious," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">warned YouTuber ItzKeisha</a>. She also brought up a previous video of Haley's, in which she's seen seemingly making a face, gesturing towards, and shaking her head at two women sitting behind her in hijabs.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Her TikTok video again had people accusing her of being privileged.</h2><p>In her "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">i accidentally got tik tok famous...??</a>" video, Haley discusses how she went from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">165,000 followers to 545,000 followers</a> in one month. She said that she had previously not used the app since it was Musical.ly, but decided to try to go viral after her boyfriend, Ryan Trahan, attempted to get to a million followers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: youtube</span></figure><p>Commenters were quick to point out that she not only already had an established following before her attempt, but also that going viral on one platform isn't particularly difficult when you have a significant following on other platforms, like she does on YouTube and Instagram.</p><p>After seeing so many negative comments, Haley removed the video, only to put it up a few hours later with a disclaimer, saying that she had not promoted any TikTok activity on her other platforms. Plus, she added that people were taking the video too seriously because it was meant to be satire anyways.&nbsp;</p><p>She clarified further that some of it was real, other parts were sarcastic. Her fans immediately took to her comment section on the re-uploaded video to say that of course it was satire and no one should be taking it seriously. Haley also added a statement under the video, writing, "DON'T TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY IT IS TIK TOK FOR CRYING OUT LOUD."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna6tsdhmp6GZnWLBqrfTqKI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heyimbee-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>HeyImBee - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ginnifer-goodwin-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Ginnifer Goodwin - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
