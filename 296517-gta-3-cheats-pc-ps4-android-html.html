In 2011, a version compatible with mobile phones got released.</p><h2>GTA 3 game highlights</h2><p class=align-left>In case you are wondering what the game entails, or you have never heard of it, the below points will place you into context.</p><ul><li>The GTA 3 game operates from a third person view where the player has to complete several missions. However, it is possible to run multiple tasks simultaneously since you have to wait for more events or instructions that would help you to complete the set missions. For your information, you can still roam the game’s open world and complete side mission if you are out of the primary one.</li><li>The liberty city contains Staunton, Shoreside Vale, and Portland boroughs which get unlocked as the player progresses.</li><li>To navigate the game, the GTA 3 player may jump, run or even use vehicles. Also, the combat auto-aim may be used to protect them against their enemies.</li><li>In case of explosions, melee attacks, and gunshots while progressing, a player can always grab the body armor.</li><li>If the players face damages, they can apply the game’s health pick-ups to regenerate. If the loss is beyond regeneration, the gameplay will stop and then the player will respawn at the nearby hospital. Remember, they will lose a lump sum and armor in exchange for regaining their health.</li><li>In case of a crime, the game’s law enforcement agencies respond according to the “wanted meter” display. Since the officers will be looking for a player leaving the “wanted” vicinity, the meter will enter a cool-down mode where it will recede after the player is out of sight.</li><li>While the story progresses, Claude will be meeting some new characters from the gangs. For instance; fellow gang members protect their players while the rivals will shoot the players.</li><li>During the free roaming, Players may also engage in fire fighting, vigilante minigame, taxi, and even paramedic services.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fa16ffdcc0ccfb74.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best multiplayer horror games you should play in 2021</span></p></a><h3>GTA 3 cheats for PC</h3><p class=align-left>Since the GTA 3 version for PC is available, nothing should separate you from enjoying the awesome game. Grab the below cheat hints and codes for successful missions.</p><h4><strong>1. How to customize music</strong></h4><p class=align-left>If you enjoy playing a game while listening to background music, do not miss this. Copy your preferred mp3 file into the GTA 3 game folder and start the game. After that, the new radio station entitled “mp3 player” will appear. Click or tap on it to listen to your uploaded music.</p><h4><strong>2. Fit more cars in your hideout garage</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Try to park more cars in your garage than the recommended. For instance; you can try to fit four to five vehicles in a garage supposed to hold two cars. This is manageable if you park two next to a wall (besides each other.)

For your information, the trick applies when the cars are parked very close.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fa815514254db30a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 fun games to play over the phone with friends in 2021</span></p></a><h4><strong>3.
