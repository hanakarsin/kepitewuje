The caption read: "It is with great sadness that NIPANC has heard of the death of Professor Jim Dornan, who died in the UAE on 15 March."</p><p>It also said: "He was internationally renowned as a world-class obstetrician and gynecologist. His relationship with NIPANC was founded on his own family’s experience of this terrible cancer, with the tragic death of his first wife, Lorna, more than twenty years ago."
