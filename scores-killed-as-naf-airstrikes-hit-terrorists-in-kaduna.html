However, with the assistance of the community, their nefarious plan was thwarted, although the Pastor’s son sustained injuries during the incident.</p><p>The individual clarified that the assailants had made a phone call earlier on Saturday morning, demanding a ransom of N3 million from the family. However, no further communication has been received from them since then.</p><p>He expressed that there has been a prevailing sense of unease within the community following the occurrence of the incident. He appealed to both security agencies and the government to assist in rescuing the traumatized widow.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that the state police command has not issued any official statement yet about the incident as of the time of filing this report.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5ByZqybn6eytHnKoqOlnZRirrR5zZqdZpmZp8C1vsiknKxlmJ7BbsDEq6moqpmowbR5yKdkpJmUqruiew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pdp-crisis-south-west-govs-in-closed-door-meeting-ahead-of-atikus-visit.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>South-West Govs In Closed-Door Meeting Ahead Of Atiku's Visit</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pdp-woos-apc-presidential-aspirant-with-govship-ticket.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>PDP Woos APC Presidential Aspirant With Gov'ship Ticket</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
