Along with her husband, Chip, the Fixer Upper phenom feels almost immortal at this point. With several <a href=#>spinoffs</a>, an entire television network, and deals with stores like Target, the couple is pretty hard to miss.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Recently, Joanna posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo of herself in the hospital</a>, which prompted replies from fans riddled with concern. Mortality has suddenly crept in! Obviously, the design world just wouldn't be the same without Joanna, and folks are naturally curious about what happened.</p><p>Is Joanna Gaines sick?

In her Instagram post, Joanna shared that she injured her back in high school while <a href=#>cheerleading</a>. According to Joanna, it was "basically a basket toss turned injury" and she's been suffering ever since.</p><p>She elaborated saying, "I had my first microdiscectomy in 2001 and had to cancel my second date with Chip Carter Gaines and then had the same procedure on another disc two weeks ago." She attributes her back feeling wonky to the stress of the holiday season and boy, do we get it.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Ever the optimist, Joanna turned this frown upside down by waxing poetic about forced bedrest.</p><p>"It has been a gift to simply stay put, stare at the wonder all around, and just be still," she wrote. She then ended the post by wishing everyone a "beautiful <a href=#>Christmas week</a>." Joanna also reminded us that "it may not all go as planned, but may you find the beauty and embrace the wonder of the here and now."</p><p>Speaking of the holidays, Joanna recently wrote a memoir and it's the perfect gift.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joanna Gaines's memoir is filled with truth and gratittude.</h2><p>In a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Joanna talked about what it took to turn her life thus far into a book. Strangely enough, the impetus for writing it stemmed from feeling "<a href=#>burnt out</a>." The 44-year-old mogul needed to find some peace, so she took a trip back in time. "I was about to turn 44 and I realized, the last 10 years, a lot of it felt like a blur," she shared.</p><p>"It was fast, it was exciting, and there was so much to be grateful for, but there was something in me that just felt so tired. I wanted to go back and regain moments that I had missed along the way."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Her memoir is titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Stories We Tell</a> and it came together after Joanna <a href=#>began journaling</a>.</p><p>"In the beginning, I never thought I would share this with anyone," she told People. "But then when I realized in that vulnerability, when you do share your story, if it inspires one other person to write their story down so that they can see that clarity and purpose in their own life, it's worth it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButs6apaeZXZyuqrrErGSsoZOg</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./378367-lets-stop-insults-william-ruto-urges-leaders-days-cs-tobiko-called-clerk-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Let's stop insults: William Ruto urges leaders days after CS Tobiko called him clerk</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./siestakeys-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Siesta Key - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
