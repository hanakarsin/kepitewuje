Probably, any other person wouldn’t have been able to do better than what he is doing in the circumstance he found himself. We might be thinking that is he not the same Buhari of 1983? He is the same person but the situation then is different now.</p><p>“The president did not just inherit those troubles. The president is leading from a very difficult angle. People who were supposed to support him are the ones that are pulling him down by their actions, utterances, inactions and by their silence.</p><p>“This is the situation the president found himself in from 2015 to date. And let anybody challenge me with what I said and I will prove it with veritable figures and facts,” Bello said.</p><p>Bello went further to balme these alleged saboteurs for the recorded failures of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>President Buhari</a></strong> since he assumed power democratically in 2015.</p><p>The Governor argued that Buhari had shown what he could do when he was a military head of state but those working against him now are the ones preventing him from opeating at full capacity and making it seem like he is unable to defeat the Boko Haram Terrorists and other insurgents, adding that he has faced a similar situation in Kogi State but the resolve to fix the nation remains undetered.</p><p>His words: “But people are now asking that is it not under the same Buhari the refineries were built? Is it not the same Buhari that was able to build roads, hospitals and other infrastructures and that was he not the same Buhari that drove away Maitatsine? So Nigerians are now asking that what is Boko haram and bandits that he (president) can’t just clear off, but then we need to reflect those that are pulling him down.”</p><p>“He said he fought against a similar situation in Kogi, adding that “this is why we are having the successes today. We will fix this country.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze49uZqynnZp6sbHOqaOeZaeewam1zWaZrqCRp7Zus86vq2asoq62r7OMraZmqKWhuW60yKZknaeno3qqecearZ5llpawtb%2BMmqWdZZaetLa%2BxKxkspmYlsaiecGeo6WnXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./drakeo-the-ruler-and-yg-beef.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Drakeo the Ruler Had Beef With This West Coast Rapper Before His Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emmanuella.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Emmanuella On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
