In <a href=#>Season 5</a>, she also fell out with Ethan’s sister, <a href=#>Moriah Plath</a>, her best friend.</p><p>Although Olivia doesn’t mind keeping her in-laws in check, she has a loving family of origin that gave her a similar upbringing as the one she and Ethan want to avoid.</p><p>Here’s everything to know about Olivia Plath’s family!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@oliviamarieplath</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Olivia Plath’s family is almost as big as her ‘Welcome to Plathville’ in-laws.</h2><p>Despite her issues with her in-laws, Olivia and Ethan seemingly have a solid marriage. The pair have several things in common, especially regarding their families.</p><p>Olivia grew up in a <a href=#>Quiverfull family</a> that practiced the same beliefs as the Plaths. Her parents, Don and Karen Meggs, raised Olivia and her eight siblings — Olivia, Micah, Elijah, Joshua, Elise, Lydia, Sophia, Nathan, Carris, and Kristen.</p><p>Like the Plaths, the siblings followed their parents’ religious restrictions and discussed their beliefs in a documentary called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Family Revival: The Meggs</a> in 2019. Since Olivia’s rise to fame on Welcome to Plathville, her family has also been in the spotlight.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@oliviamarieplath</a></figure><p>In May 2023, Olivia opened up about a family tragedy via Instagram. She announced in an Instagram story that her brother, Micah, passed away at age 15 from a car crash, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">InTouch Weekly</a>. According to Micah’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">obituary</a>, the teenager also “suffered his entire life from Cerebral Palsy caused by a Brachial Plexus injury during his birth.”</p><p>“I’ve rewritten this a few times because somehow I have no words, even though inside of me is a vortex of every emotion possible,” Olivia wrote on Instagram under a photo of her and Micah. “You’ll always be in my heart, Micah Titus. You deserved so much, and I don’t think you knew just how loved you are. ♥️I will miss your laugh so much.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Olivia Marie Plath (@oliviamarieplath)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Olivia Plath’s family tragedy came after reuniting with a sibling she “cut ties” with for years.</h2><p>Amid the tragic loss of Olivia’s brother, Micah, she found support from her siblings. As fans saw on Season 5 of Welcome to Plathville, one of her supporters is her younger sister, <a href=#>Lydia Grace Meggs</a>.</p><p>In Season 5, Olivia and Lydia Grace went out on the town with their brother, <a href=#>Nathan Meggs</a>. During another episode in the season, the sisters spoke about their upbringing and the challenges it brought to their social life. One example was them having to wear “dresses” or “boy shorts” to the pool to avoid men “undressing” them with their eyes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TLC (@tlc)</a></p></figure><p>"I remember thinking I might be lesbian because I didn't want anything to do with men if they were like that,” Lydia Grace says in the clip, with Olivia adding, “To this day, I somewhat wonder. I'm like, ‘Huh, men.'"</p><p>While the sisters can laugh about their journeys now, Olivia previously shared on the show that they weren’t always on the best of terms. She said she “cut ties” with her sister after they were teenagers because, “My parents thought Lydia was walking the fine line to hell.” Thankfully, Olivia has since come around, and the siblings are closer than ever.</p><p>Catch new episodes of Welcome to Plathville on Tuesdays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLmqwsiaZKmkkam1brLApqClsQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./411620-32-year-old-woman-who-dropped-out-school-2006-scores-b-2020-kcse-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>32-Year-Old Woman Who Dropped Out of School in 2006 Scores B+ in 2020 KCSE</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gen-z-daughter-and-boyfriend-door-closed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mom Catches Gen Z Daughter With Boyfriend Behind Closed Doors</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
