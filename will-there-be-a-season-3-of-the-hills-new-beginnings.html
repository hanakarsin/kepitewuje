After an interesting reboot in Season 1, fans naturally called for another season and got their wish. This show has shown that our favorite friend group has grown up a lot over the years. Now, as adults, they are tackling parenthood, starting and maintaining businesses, and navigating relationships.</p><p>Since The Hills continues to be a trending topic on social media and brings in rave reviews and ratings, viewers are hoping that Season 3 is on the table. However, <a href=#>Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt</a> have some reservations about that fact — especially since things with this group can always change.</p><p>Will there be a Season 3 of The Hills: New Beginnings? Get comfortable as we spill the tea.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Heidi and Spencer believe that Season 3 of ‘The Hills’ will need a new cast.</h2><p>If you’ve been rocking with The Hills — the spinoff to <a href=#>Laguna Beach</a> — since its start in 2006, then you know that this show takes drama to the next level. And while The Hills: New Beginnings is in full swing with a few missing faces, Heidi and Spencer are still along for the ride.</p><p>That said, The Hills has shown viewers a new side to the once-hated couple. Viewers have said that the pair has definitely grown on them since they seem to be in a better place. However, Season 2 has the couple finding themselves in the middle of drama. And it has left people wondering if Season 3 is in the cards.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET</a>, Heidi and Spencer let out all their feelings about other cast members on Season 2 and spilled about the likelihood of a Season 3.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It's such a strange feeling to not completely hate Spencer and Heidi <a href=#>#TheHillsNewBeginnings</a></p>— katie.

"We don't even know what people are saying in their testimonials."</p><p>A quick peruse through Season 2’s trailer shows that some serious issues took place between cast members. And Heidi and Spencer shared that they were often targets.&nbsp;</p><p>"I feel like Speidi's on the chopping block a lot," Heidi told the outlet. "I think there were a lot of high emotions and a lot of heightened things going on for everybody, so I think we were an easy target for a lot of people."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">MTV has not yet confirmed if ‘The Hills’ Season 3 will be coming to the small screen.</h2><p>Like it or not, The Hills has made major contributions to pop culture. From the end of&nbsp;Lauren Conrad and Heidi’s friendship to Heidi’s run with plastic surgery, those moments live rent-free in viewers' heads.</p><p>And since the support of The Hills franchise continues to grow, fans are expecting Season 3 to go off without a hitch. However, MTV has been pretty mum on the topic of another season.</p><p>Most showrunners announce new seasons in the middle or end of the current season. So, there is still a lot of time before MTV should make the grand announcement.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><p>Although there is drama brewing within the friend group that will likely blow up as we get into the thick of Season 2, that's something that producers probably approve of. After all, drama among the crew always boosts ratings.</p><p>With that in mind, fans shouldn’t rule out Season 3 of The Hills: New Beginnings. Sure, producers may add new faces to the mix, but we’re sure that some of the veterans will also be part of the show. But, only time will tell.</p><p>Watch Heidi and Spencer on&nbsp;The Hills: New Beginnings&nbsp;Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST on MTV.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIytn56qlWKvpnnAZqqemaOku25%2FjKidZqyYmnqptculqmamlax6o7HGoqWnoZ6cwA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-movie-i-produced-led-to-me-having-stroke-nollywood-actor-seeks-financial-help.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Movie I Produced Led To Me Having Stroke</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./imogen-tear-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Imogen Tear - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
