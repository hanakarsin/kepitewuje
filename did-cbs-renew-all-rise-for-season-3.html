Before being abruptly canceled, All Rise was one of the most popular legal dramas on the network. But it seems like it is not over for the show just yet, and there will be a Season 3. Did CBS renew the series? Keep reading to find out if they did.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">CBS did not renew 'All Rise' for Season 3.</h2><p>CBS did not end up renewing All Rise for Season 3. However, right after the network canceled the show, Warner Bros. Television Group Chairman Channing Dungey began working to find the series a new home. Talks with the network OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network began three months after CBS decided not to move forward with a new season.</p><p>OWN has officially closed a deal for a third season of the legal drama that will include 20 episodes.</p><p>The series is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">slated to air in June 2022</a>, and showrunner Dee Harris-Lawrence will also return for Season 3. Dee was recruited to co-run All Rise after Greg was let go by the network but will be the sole showrunner for the new season. After the announcement of the show moving to OWN, the network's president, Tina Perry, said: “All Rise has been a great performer, achieving strong ratings and growing its share from Season 1 to 2" (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>She continued, "Featuring a strong character front and center, Judge Lola Carmichael’s story reflects our audience with powerful affirmation. A special thanks to Warner Bros. Television and our incredible showrunner and longtime partner Dee Harris-Lawrence. We can’t wait to get started on Season 3 and bring this show back for long-standing and new fans alike." Warner Bros. president Brett Paul also shared his enthusiasm about the show being renewed for Season 3.</p><p>He shared, “We are incredibly thrilled that All Rise will be back in court, and we are thankful to our great partners at OWN for ruling in favor of another season of this powerful drama. Dee Harris-Lawrence and the creative team have done an incredible job of telling important stories about timely subjects which have been brought to life by Simone Missick and the show’s outstanding ensemble cast. We can’t wait for audiences to see what the All Rise team has in store for Season 3."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Brett added, "And we are also grateful to our partners at HBO Max and Hulu, without whose support this would not be possible."</p><p>We can't wait for All Rise to return on June 7 at 8 PM ET on OWN.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecKbqmaqlaOyuHnApaNmqpmosm6yzqtkrJ2RqLyveZI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ballerina-farm-husband.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Interview With Ballerina Farm Shares How She Met Her Husband</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./barry-gibb-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Barry Gibb - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
