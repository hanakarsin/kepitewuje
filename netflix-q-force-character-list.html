The TV-MA animated series Q-Force is what happens when you take super-spies in the LGBTQ+ community and give them some badass missions to prove themselves. Because that's exactly what it is, complete with a ton of fun characters and big names voicing them.</p><p>So, who is in the Q-Force list of characters and their voice actors? Read on to find out!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Steve Maryweather</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix / Getty</span></figure><p>Steve is known as Agent Mary in the Q-Force. Before he came out as gay, he was part of the American Intelligence Agency. Now, he's in charge of the Q-Force team. He's basically the Batman of his own version of the Justice League. Kind of.</p><p>Sean Hayes voices Agent Mary and it's hard not to immediately recognize the actor's voice. He's well-known for his role in Will & Grace. He also hosts the podcast SmartLess these days, so his voice is a big deal outside of Q-Force too.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Director Dirk Chunley</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix / Getty</span></figure><p>Although he's not part of the Q-Force, Dirk plays a part in the Q-Force series. He's the hardened director of the American Intelligence Agency. He's voiced by Gary Cole, who has starred in movies such as Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, Office Space, and One Hour Photo, just to name a few. He also voiced characters in the shows Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law and Kim Possible.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Agent Rick Buck</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix / Getty</span></figure><p>Agent Buck is straight, but he's also part of the Q-Force. Once the team becomes official, he's brought in. The actor who voices Agent Rick in Q-Force? None other than our Netflix veteran and <a href=#>Stranger Things </a>hero David Harbour.</p><p>He has also lent his voice to The Simpsons, Big City Greens, and Star Wars: Visions, so being a voice actor is nothing new for him.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Stat</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix / Getty</span></figure><p>Stat is Q-Force's resident tough spy, who likes to be alone. Patti Harrison, who is both an actress and TV writer, voices Stat.</p><p>Outside Q-Force, Patti has written for Big Mouth and I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson. She has also acted in Shrill and voiced characters in Bob's Burgers and BoJack Horseman.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">V</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix / Getty</span></figure><p>Although V works directly under Dirk for the American Intelligence Agency, she isn't as hardened as him and has a soft spot for some members of the Q-Force.</p><p>Laurie Metcalf, aka Aunt Jackie from Roseanne and The Conners, voices her in the show. Laurie has been in a ton of other TV shows and movies over the years, and her voice is incredibly recognizable.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Twink</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix / Getty</span></figure><p>Twink's superpower in the Q-Force is the ability to dress in drag to the point where he's unrecognizable. Matt Rogers, who served as a producer for the Gayme Show and CollegeHumor Originals, plays Twink in the show.</p><p>He also voiced characters in Our Cartoon President and he was in an episode of Search Party.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Deb</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix / Getty</span></figure><p>Deb identifies as a lesbian and is a happily married member of the Q-Force. Other than that, she's a mechanic and brings a lot to the crew. Wanda Sykes voices Deb. In case you've been living under a rock, Wanda is a known comedian and actress from TV shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Good Fight.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Benji</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix / Getty</span></figure><p>As Agent Mary's boyfriend, Benji isn't part of the Q-Force. He does, however, often find himself in imminent danger. And their relationship serves as a b-plot at times.</p><p>Gabe Liedman, known as a writer for shows like Pen15 and Broad City, voices Benji. He's also one of the Q-Force writers, along with Sean Hayes and The Office's Michael Schur.</p><p>That's right — as if you needed another reason to watch Q-Force, the genius behind the U.S. version of The Office is also involved in it.</p><p>So pull on your best undies over tights and get ready to save the world with the rest of the crew. Or, you know, just watch it from home like a normal person. But you get it. The star-studded cast is kind of hard to ignore.</p><p>Q-Force is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7K1ssuir2apXZu8s6%2FEZpqhmaKWsLWx0Wajoquk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-sk-going-to-school-for-love-is-blind.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Love Is Blind:' What Is SK Going to School For?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./presidential-aspirant-bala-mohammed-secretly-buys-bauchi-governorship-form.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Presidential Aspirant, Bala Mohammed, Secretly Buys Bauchi Governorship Form</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
