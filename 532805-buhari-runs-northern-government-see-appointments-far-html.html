But what has worried critics more is the seeming lack of regional balance in the appointments, a failing Buhari has been forcefully condemned for in the past.</p><p>In violation of federal law the president has appointed by far more persons&nbsp;from Nigeria’s northern region where he hails.</p><p>Under the Third Schedule of the Constitution, the administration must enable “<i>the principles of proportional sharing of all bureaucratic, economic, media and political posts at all levels of government”.</i></p><p>The positions mentioned to include those of the permanent secretaries, directors-general in extra-ministerial departments and parastatals, directors in ministries and extra-ministerial departments, senior military officers, senior diplomatic posts and managerial cadres in the Federal and State parastatals, bodies, agencies and institutions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt750av7eq8fr.jpeg><p>Premium Times reports that only 25 % of Buhari’s appointments are from the south while an overwhelming 75 % are the north.</p><p>Also, Buhari’s North West geopolitical zone, has the biggest share of 41 %, whiles the South East for instance, has no appointee.</p><p>Some critics even called Buhari the most provincial leader ever.</p><p><i>“Buhari is the most provincial leader Nigeria has ever had</i>,” said Ikechukwu Amaechi, a former editor of Daily Independent and Editor-in-Chief of The Niche, in a post on his Facebook page.</p><p>“<i>He is not fit to be President of Nigeria. How can he continue appointing top officials of government from the north? Customs, Immigration bosses, SGF, Chief of Staff all from the North?”</i></p><p><i>“If I am President Muhammadu Buhari, I would have appointed a South Easterner as SGF,”</i> said Sunday Akoji, a public affairs commentator.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Buhari Appoints SGF, CSO, Others</p><p><i>“If I am Baba, I will not appoint five people from the north into sensitive positions in one day and throw one worthless carrot called SSA on National Assembly Matters to the entire South.”</i></p><p>Chukwuemeka Ezeife, a former governor of Anambra state, condemned the president for not considering an Igbo for any political nomination so far.</p><p><i>“I don’t understand what is going on,”</i> he told reporters. “<i>It appears Buhari has some messages for various people.</i></p><p><i>“I don’t know what to say. If it (appointment) is only for the North, it is okay.”</i></p><p>Yinka Odumakin, the spokesman of Afenifere, a Yoruba socio-cultural group, said Buhari’s action poses serious danger to Nigeria.</p><p>He said: <i>“It is not healthy for a plural society. There are competent people across the nation. When you do this there can’t be a balance. We need constructive surgery, not bulldozing.”</i></p><p>Buhari has come under criticisms for his actions as Nigeria’s leader so far. In his government’s short term, he has drawn fire for his delay&nbsp;in making a cabinet, and for appearing not to be in haste to fix a nation faced with huge problems.</p><p>His recent appointments too were believed unequal for a nation that holds together six geopolitical zones, 36 states and a federal capital territory, 774 local governments and over 250 different ethnic nationalities.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Buhari Sheds Light On NNPC Appointments</p><p>It should be also noted that President Buhari received the least number of votes in the South East and South South, the political stronghold of his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan.</p><p>It is not pure whether the appointments are in demonstration of that belief.</p><p>So far, President Buhari has made 35 appointments.
