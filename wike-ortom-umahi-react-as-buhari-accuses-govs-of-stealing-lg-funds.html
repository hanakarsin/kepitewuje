What I’m hundred per cent sure of is that his accusation does not apply to Rivers State.</p><p>“I hear some governors dip hands into LG funds, but in Rivers, the governor, rather augments LG finances to keep them solvent, so that they can regularly pay teachers salaries and benefits to their staff as at when due. That has been the tradition under Governor Nyesom Wike.”</p><h2>Benue&nbsp;Govt Reacts</h2><p>Also reacting, Benue State Government, through the spokesman to governor Ortom, <strong>Terver Akase</strong>, distanced itself from the allegation by the president,</p><p>Akase said the governor was the first to embrace local government financial autonomy and couldn’t have been involved in stealing LG funds.</p><p>He said: “If other states are stealing local government funds, it is not in Benue.</p><p>“Governor Samuel Ortom does not steal local government funds because he is a transparent governor. Recall that when the Federal Government started sending money directly to local governments, he was the first who embraced it.</p><p>“When the judiciary was to be given autonomy, he was the first to accept it. He is someone, who has no skeletons in his cupboard.</p><p>“If that allegation is true in other states, it is not the same in Benue State because our governor is transparent and he believes in the rule of law. He allows government agencies to operate as provided by law.</p><p>”That is why he has conducted more elections for the local governments than any other time in the history of the state. He has allowed democracy to be entrenched at the local government level.</p><p>”As we speak, we have elected local government chairmen and councillors in place. He does not interfere in the running of the local governments. So, that allegation does not obtain in Benue State.</p><p>“I am not saying the President is wrong but what I am saying is that it does not happen in Benue State. Our governor does not pilfer, embezzle or steal local government funds.”</p><h2>Ebonyi Govt Speaks</h2><p>Reacting in a similar manner, Governor Umahi said the allegation by President Buhari doesn’t apply to Ebony state, considering the quantum of projects executed by his administration.</p><p>The governor’s media aide, <strong>Chuks Oko</strong>,&nbsp;said: “The quantum of development going on in Ebonyi will leave no one in doubt that such accusation does not apply to my governor.</p><p>“We have won several awards from the World Bank on fiscal prudence, accountability, and transparency and they clearly stand Umahi out as one who uses allocations for what they are meant for.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49rZrChm5p6sL7TqKRmrZ2Wtap50Z6YnKxdlsBurtShmKuhXZawpMHSnqpmn5%2BrwG67xWaqrZ2Robavs4ylnmaepaOxtHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./flack-season-2-amazon-prime.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Flack' Is Finally Streaming on Amazon Prime After Pop TV Cancellation</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./topic.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About AY On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
