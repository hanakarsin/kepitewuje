He did it in protest of police brutality against Black people and, although some other players stood behind him in his decision to take a stand, he is no longer on a set team, but a free agent in the NFL.</p><p>These days, Colin is an activist for people of color and, with a Netflix series set to begin production about his life and growing up in his white adoptive family‚Äôs home as a mixed race person, the details of his upbringing will be brought to light. Naturally, people are curious about what it was like and what his relationship is with his parents, both adoptive and blood related, is like today.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Colin Kaepernick‚Äôs parents?</h2><p>Colin was born to a white mother named Heidi Russo and a Black father with Ghana and Nigeria ancestry. Not long after he was born, he was adopted into a white family and grew up with Rick Kaepernick and Teresa Kaepernick as his parents, along with their two older children, who became his adoptive siblings.</p><p>Heidi explained to the Denver Post that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>she gave birth to Colin</u></a> when she was 19 and, scared and alone, she gave him up for adoption just a few weeks later. From there, the Kaepernicks raised and cared for Colin, honing his affinity for sports and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>helping to instill in him values</u></a> that, Colin explained to Us Weekly, he took with him throughout his life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: VH1</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Colin has siblings from his adoptive family and birth mother.</h2><p>Although Colin‚Äôs Instagram is a testament to his activism for the Black community, he has remained close to his family throughout his NFL career. He has two older siblings, Kyle and Devon Kaepernick, from his adoptive family, and three younger siblings through his birth mother. Unfortunately, it appears as though Colin has never met his birth mother and, because he remains so dedicated to his adoptive family, there might not ever be a need for that on his part.</p><p>On VH1‚Äôs Dear Mama in 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Colin praised his adoptive mother and family</u></a> despite feeling different from them from a young age.</p><p>"You have a family that you love, but you know you don‚Äôt look like," he said at the time. "And at a young age‚Ä¶ I understood that I was different, I didn't understand what that meant." He explained that he and his family worked through the struggle of understanding together. "We‚Äôve always been very loving in the process and I wouldn't do it with anybody else," he added.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>‚Ä™Structural racism makes Black & Brown ppl more likely to die from #COVID19.

And although he excelled in baseball, college football was his goal. Turlock is a small, predominantly white town. And although Colin felt loved and secure in his family, he saw the difference in the color of his skin from them and plenty of his classmates from a young age.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">His Netflix limited series will explain his upbringing.</h2><p>Netflix will air a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>six-part series</u></a> based around Colin‚Äôs life and upbringing and how he grew into a household name for both football and human rights. The series will feature a cast playing a younger version of Colin and his family and he will serve as narrator for the limited series. Although there‚Äôs no release date set just yet, the series, Colin in Black & White, is a sure thing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLyttc1mopqdoJq%2Fr7XCpGSpmaKau7W%2F</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lexee-smith-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lexee Smith - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tyler-oakley-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Tyler Oakley - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
