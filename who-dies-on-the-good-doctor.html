Did Dr. Audrey Lim survive the Season 6 premiere? Find out if the ABC series killed off a cast member in its return.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p><strong>WARNING: Spoilers for </strong><strong>The Good Doctor</strong><strong> Season 6 premiere, "Afterparty."</strong></p><p>ABC's <a href=#>The Good Doctor</a> terrified fans with its Season 5 cliffhanger, in which Nurse Dalisay Villanueva's abusive ex-boyfriend Owen caused havoc at <a href=#>Shaun and Lea's long-awaited wedding</a>. What should've been a happy day for the show's characters instead ended with their doing everything possible to save lives, while viewers had to wait months to find out if they were successful.</p><p>The characters whose fates were up in the air were Dr. Audrey Lim (played by <a href=#>Christina Chang</a>) and Villanueva herself (portrayed by Elina Luk). The Season 6 premiere, entitled "Afterparty," finally revealed if one or both characters were leaving the show.</p><p>Would The Good Doctor drive a knife into fans' hearts in the season's very first episode? Or did everyone get to breathe a sigh of relief? Read on to find out who died on The Good Doctor.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Jeff Waddell/ABC</span><p>Shaun (Freddie Highmore, center) scrambles to save a life in 'The Good Doctor' Season 6.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Dr. Audrey Lim and Nurse Dalisay Villanueva die in the Season 6 premiere of 'The Good Doctor'?</h2><p>Season 5 of The Good Doctor introduced a domestic violence storyline, with Dalisay opening up to Audrey about her experience with Owen. Audrey offered to let Dalisay move in with her during the season's penultimate episode, "The Lea Show," and Dalisay accepted. But fans were convinced that they hadn't seen the last of Owen—and were proven right in the very next installment!</p><p>While both Audrey and Dalisay were violently attacked, the team was able to save both of their lives. However, that came at a high price: Audrey survived two consecutive risky surgeries, only to discover that the procedures had left her paralyzed!</p><p>The fallout as she deals with her condition and Shaun questions his choices will be part of Season 6.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Jeff Waddell/ABC</span><p>Jordan (Bria Henderson) and Shaun (Freddie Highmore) work to save Audrey in 'The Good Doctor' Season 6.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Dr. Audrey Lim paralyzed for good on 'The Good Doctor'?</h2><p>While The Good Doctor fans are thrilled that Audrey survived, the outcome of "Afterparty" looks particularly grim for her. Being paralyzed is completely life-changing, and would seem to be the end of her medical career at St. Bonaventure, or at least a major obstacle to overcome before she can go back to work.</p><p>Does that mean the character is still going to end up leaving the show — or at least have a complete storyline change? Unsurprisingly, co-showrunner Liz Friedman is refusing to say. When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TVLine</a> asked if Audrey's paralysis is permanent, Liz demurred because she didn't want to "ruin the suspense." Viewers will have to keep tuning in to see what's next for Audrey.</p><p>In the meanwhile, upcoming episodes will deal with not only her and Dalisay's aftermath but also what Shaun goes through knowing that he disobeyed orders from his mentor Dr. Aaron Glassman (<a href=#>Richard Schiff</a>) during the fight to save Audrey's life. How much responsibility does he feel for her current condition?</p><p>"There will be emotional repercussions," Liz teased, adding, "Shaun's feelings about Lim's [outcome] are really interesting."</p><p>While fans now know who died (or actually didn't!) on The Good Doctor, the show has now opened itself up to a fresh wave of speculation about if Audrey will ever be the same—and what the attempts on her and Dalisay's lives mean not only for them, but for everyone else at St. Bonaventure.</p><p>The Good Doctor airs Mondays at 10:00 p.m. EST on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecOinKxln6N6tbTEZp6op5RisbCv06ip</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fuji-singer-saheed-osupa-bags-first-degree-from-university-of-ibadan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fuji Singer, Saheed Osupa Bags First Degree From University Of Ibadan</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./423116-top-15-celebrities-bad-teeth-2021-pictures-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top 15 celebrities with bad teeth in 2021 (with pictures)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
