Kalani expects her now-husband to contribute more to their family, but Asuelu seems stuck in his traditional Samoan ways.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>During a recent episode of the hit TLC reality series, Asuelu angered fans after making a few sexist remarks. The 90 Day Fiancé star was shocked after learning that his kids' doctor is a female.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, with Asuelu off at work, it is custom in Samoan culture for a woman to be the homemaker of the family, but Kalani feels he needs to contribute more to the family outside of simply working. When Kalani brought this to her husband's attention, he called her a "lying b--tch" and insulted her voice. Yikes!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This isn't the first time fans have seen Asuelu get angry on-camera. During the 90 Day Fiancé tell-all, the reality star became restless with the fighting and began hitting himself in the head. Fans of the reality series started questioning Asuelu's actions, and one person reportedly commented that the television personality was <a href=#>on the spectrum</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'90 Day Fiance' fan accuses Asuelu of having autism.</h2><p>Following Asuelu's behavior during the tell-all special, an Instagram user reportedly commented on Kalani's sister Kolini's posts. "This is not meant to be [mean] spirited, but there’s an elephant in the room, a lot of people are saying that Asuelu’s behavior shows signs of autism or some sort of delay or disorder, are you aware of him having Asperger’s syndrome or being someplace on the autism spectrum?” the person wrote (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Additionally, the fan wrote, “So many people are commenting that his behavior mimics that of those who do have such disorders. He doesn’t even understand the simple things such as spending money to help with the baby while he is in Samoa, he doesn’t understand things other people just see as second nature and know naturally. He struggles and it shows in his blank stares and reactions to certain situations."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Adding, "Just wondering if he may be delayed and that is why [Kalani] is nervous to leave the baby alone with him, which I would also be. Hopefully someone will get him the proper help to see if he does have any of these issues so he can be the best parent and partner for your sister.” &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kalani's sister Kolini shuts down rumors that Asuelu is autistic.</h2><p>Silencing the social media rumors that her sister's husband is on the spectrum, she commented, “My mom worked with autistic children for most of my life as a behaviorist. She instantly knows when someone is on the spectrum. I understand the way it looked when it seemed like he was in sensory overload — but that wasn’t at all the case. It was ‘I’m sick of f--king taping’ overload."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>She continued, “I’ve spent plenty of time with Asuelu to know that he’s not autistic. He’s not slow. The way he spoke in interviews isn’t the way you’d hear him speak in person or the way you’d hear him speak Samoan. If he was needing to be evaluated, my family would know.”&nbsp;</p><p>Catch new episodes of 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? on Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsC2scuuZHJoXZmuunnFopinm5VirrbAyKyk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./you-can-eat-my-money-but-you-have-to-be-obedient-bobrisky-explains-to-daddy-freeze.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'You Can Eat My Money But You Have To Be Obedient'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cody-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Famous Codys | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./where-was-christmas-on-ice-filmed.html>'Christmas on Ice' Features the Perfect Holiday Setting for a Good Reason</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nigerias-forex-crisis-is-artificial-and-deliberate-ooni-of-ife.html>Nigeria's Forex Crisis Is Artificial And Deliberate</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-omokri-states-position-on-muslim-muslim-ticket-tackles-osinbajo.html>Omokri States Position On Muslim-Muslim Ticket, Tackles Osinbajo</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-shawshank-redemption-html.html>The Shawshank Redemption | Famous Birthdays</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./man-finds-fin-trader-joes-salmon.html>Customer Exposes Trader Joe's for Selling Salmon Fillet With Visible Fin</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveVlog.
