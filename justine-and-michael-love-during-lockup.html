Add to that kids, cameras, and everything in between, and Season 2 of <a href=#>Love During Lockup</a> is a straight-up mess. But <a href=#>Justine</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael</a> are here to share their love story.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So, who are Justine and Michael in Love During Lockup? In an exclusive clip obtained by Distractify ahead of the Nov. 11 episode, Michael and Justine celebrate their wedding on the phone and share the experience with their family who couldn't be there in person to see their nuptials. Plus, Michael also reveals his release date.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Justine and Michael from 'Love During Lockup'?</h2><p>Justine and Michael met through his mother, of all people, and apparently, mom knows best since the couple gets married this season. In the exclusive clip, Michael reveals that he has just nine weeks left on his sentence for drug-related charges, and Justine is eager for him to come home.</p><p>He even sends a surprise gift to her, though the clip doesn't share what it is. Clearly, however, these two have remained close despite their circumstances.</p><p>Outside of Love During Lockup, Michael is a rapper under the name Montana Millz.

His Instagram proves how close the two are as he captioned a photo of the pair, "Bonnie and Clyde." Well, the Insta quote may not be the best comparison for someone who was recently released from prison, but we get it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is 'Love During Lockup's' wedding between Justine and Michael real?</h2><p>Justine and Michael get married in Season 2 of Love During Lockup, but some of the show's fans aren't convinced that their wedding is the real deal. However, according to documents obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starcasm</a>, Justine and Michael did get married while Michael was still incarcerated in August 2022.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>And, judging by their individual social media activity since then, it's safe to say Michael and Justine are still together after Love During Lockup. But getting married while one spouse is incarcerated and while much of their relationship is filmed for reality TV certainly comes with its pitfalls.
