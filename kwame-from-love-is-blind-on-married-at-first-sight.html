But what about reality marriage series?</p><p>From <a href=#>Love Is Blind</a> to <a href=#>Married at First Sight</a>, the stakes are infinitely higher — considering the words, “I do,” are involved. And most people in these spousal-centric series get one shot at finding their other half.</p><p>However, that’s not always the case.</p><p>Recently, Love Is Blind Season 4 star <a href=#>Kwame</a> was spotted on another show looking for a wife.

A TikTok creator spotted the reality star in Season 10 of the reality series.</h2><p>Love Is Blind Season 4 wasn’t Kwame’s first attempt to find love on reality television! Did you know the 33-year-old contestant attended a casting call for Season 10 of Married at First Sight in 2019?</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@piebus</a> on TikTok first spotted the former soccer player in a clip of the long-standing reality series based in Washington, D.C., writing, “Watching Married at First Sight Season 10 that was filmed in 2019, and I swear it looks like Kwame.

Donning a light blue shirt and grinning from ear to ear, his appearance was impossible to mistake. And fans in the comment section had a few thoughts.</p><p>“Oh [he's] been trying for A WHILE,” one person joked. Another added, “That is 100 percent him.” So, how did Kwame end up in Married at First Sight and Love Is Blind? Here’s what people think.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘Married at First Sight’ and ‘Love Is Blind’ share the same producers and casting team.

Additionally, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinetic Content</a> casts the stars of each show, meaning that although Kwame didn’t make the cut for Season 10 of Married at First Sight, they potentially saw something special in him and asked him to come back for Season 4 of Love Is Blind.</p><p>One fan noted the possible explanation on TikTok.</p><p>“Same producers and casting team!” they said. “I bet they asked him to re-audition.” Another viewer wrote, “Kinetic [Content] is responsible for casting talent and producing Married at First Sight & Love Is Blind.
